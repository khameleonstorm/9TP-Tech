<p>With so many new tools at your disposal, there’s no need to wonder how to improve quality in construction; here are some of the best ways to do so.</p>
<h2>8 Tips on How to Improve Quality in Construction Projects</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that it takes a lot of moving parts and collaboration across different disciplines and roles for construction projects to stay on time, under budget, and with quality at an acceptable level.</p>
<p>But how can you improve your project management capabilities so you’re able to do a better job? Here are some tips on improving the quality of construction.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25416 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pro-tips-on-how-to-improve-quality-in-construction-projects-1024x593.png" alt="Pro tips on how to improve quality in construction projects" width="1024" height="593" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pro-tips-on-how-to-improve-quality-in-construction-projects-1024x593.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pro-tips-on-how-to-improve-quality-in-construction-projects-300x174.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pro-tips-on-how-to-improve-quality-in-construction-projects-768x445.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pro-tips-on-how-to-improve-quality-in-construction-projects-600x347.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pro-tips-on-how-to-improve-quality-in-construction-projects-450x260.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pro-tips-on-how-to-improve-quality-in-construction-projects-1000x579.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pro-tips-on-how-to-improve-quality-in-construction-projects.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3>#1 Take Responsibility for Planning</h3>
<p>Proper planning and site preparation are imperative for quality in construction. That starts with a detailed job plan that’s shared among all project members, so everyone knows their role and what’s expected of them.</p>
<p>In addition, it’s important that all site activities are overseen by qualified superintendents and managers. As any good builder will tell you, quality is achieved through proper planning and execution, not by closing your eyes and wishing for success.</p>
<h3>#2 Conduct Quality Performance</h3>
<p>Various technologies in construction help monitor and enhance quality. These tools are useful because they alert management to problems before they get out of hand. This way, companies can take action before things go wrong.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/construction-project-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project management software</a> helps contractors identify defective products from suppliers as soon as possible so that rework doesn’t impact other projects.</p>
<p>Contractors can also use <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-to-introduce-construction-erp-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERP software</a> for this purpose, as it serves as the glue among several processes and legacy systems and helps to improve quality in construction.</p>
<h3>#3 Aim at Repeat Business</h3>
<p>Like in many other spheres, customer satisfaction and retention are the key factors that reflect the quality of construction. If a builder has a high number of repeat customers, it shows that he’s doing his job right.</p>
<p>Try to be as communicative as possible with your customers – give them estimates and deadlines; track their opinions; constantly ask how you can improve your work and products/services. For this aim, <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/customer-portal-software-for-construction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer portal software</a> works well.</p>
<h3>#4 Nurture a Culture of Quality</h3>
<p>By creating a culture of quality in construction from top-to-bottom, you empower everyone on your team to care about every facet of their work.</p>
<p>Among all, a leader should be proactive and foster such an environment through tools such as <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/inspection-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspection management software</a> so the workers will receive timely feedback on their work and are more likely to pay attention to what they’re doing and how they’re doing it.</p>
<p>Besides, if employees also feel that their contributions are respected and valued, chances are good that they’ll continue contributing at high levels—and helping you produce better results overall.</p>
<h3>#5 Make Smartphones Work for You</h3>
<p>Mobile devices offer a wide range of opportunities that can serve as quality-raising technologies in construction. For example, installing an app like <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Earth</a> is a great way to gain perspective on your project.</p>
<p>Also, a smartphone lets you take instant pictures on-site and send them to stakeholders, which saves time and resources for project management.</p>
<p>Many other free smartphone apps also include features that will come in handy during construction, such as tape measures, calculators, and GPS locators.</p>
<p>Having easy access to these tools will improve quality assurance during construction by giving you easy access to measurements and levels throughout projects so construction plans can be maintained.</p>
<h3>#6 Keep it Simple and Straight to the Point</h3>
<p>High project complexity is harmful to the quality of a construction project.  It requires more time, effort, and resources which may result in mistakes, materials shortages, or errors.</p>
<p>That’s why it&#8217;s so important that your plans are detailed enough to leave no room for ambiguity, but not too complex so as to cause confusion among stakeholders.</p>
<p>In practice, it means having a clear schedule of who is responsible for what aspects of your project, so there is no confusion about who is doing what and when they need to be done.</p>
<h3>#7 Resolve Defects Fast and Accurately</h3>
<p>When it comes to risk management, safety should be your top priority. Because if you’re not safe on a construction site, then you can’t move forward with a quality building—or any building at all.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are several software solutions available that can help you resolve defects and incidents faster and more accurately than ever before.</p>
<p>Among the ways of using technology to improve safety on construction sites, it’s worth <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/construction-inventory-management-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioning inspection solutions again</a>, as they can reduce unwanted human errors and improve consistency across multiple job sites throughout a region or even country. And all this comes in a preventive way, without causing the need to experience the possible danger for real.</p>
<h3>#8 Constantly Search for New Ways and Technologies in Construction Industry to Improve Quality</h3>
<p>Continuous learning is the core value of the top leaders of our age, and the construction sphere is not an exception to this rule. To succeed in the long run, you should constantly have an appetite for new tools and methods that can improve your performance and construction quality.</p>
<p>Beyond incorporating new knowledge, you should experiment in practice. That means being open and trying to use various technologies in construction, ranging from 3D printing to nanotechnology and augmented reality.</p>
<p>While deciding to try, stick to your business needs, though. Once you understand how these technologies can fit into your life and workflow, you’ll find them easier to integrate into your day-to-day projects.</p>

<h2>5 Technologies in Construction That Improve Quality Standards</h2>
<p>As construction as the industry has turned from the technological desert into a high-tech place, each of the ways to enhance quality standards in construction is impossible without technologies in place.</p>
<h3>Most Promising Technologies in Construction in 2022</h3>
<p><b>1. Cloud computing</b>.</p>
<p>As a type of software as a service that allows companies to use programs and storage on servers over a network, cloud computing allows builders to access important data when they need it, which could include blueprints, client contracts, or employee records.</p>
<p>Since cloud computing works through an internet connection, it can be accessed anywhere around the world; cloud-based technologies allow workers on-site and remote employees access to projects from any location. With advances in mobile phone technology, builders can also access information from their smartphones or tablets.</p>
<p><b>2. Advanced GPS technologies</b></p>
<p>This know-how helps in improving the accuracy and communication of construction activities, being already widely used in aerospace, military, science, and engineering.</p>
<p>Precisely, these advanced GPS technologies provide information about both horizontal or vertical position values with very high precision and update rates required by each task in any area of work or job site.</p>
<p><b>3. Build Information Modeling (BIM)</b></p>
<p>BIM is a set of software tools that links an entire building team together to let them work more efficiently and effectively. Because it enables each member of a project team to work more closely with one another, it increases their knowledge of one another’s work, which makes them better able to communicate and collaborate. This can have a huge impact on quality.</p>
<p><b>4. Laser scanning</b></p>
<p>Being among the rare tools that can help you save time and money when doing construction work, laser scanning takes a three-dimensional image of an object or space, measuring things like surface area and volume, then storing that information for future reference.</p>
<p><b>5. Data science, empowered by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</b></p>
<p>Data science is a field of study that uses data collected through observation or experimentation to learn about something. It is used for purposes such as understanding human behavior, knowledge discovery, finding useful patterns, predicting trends, and much more.</p>
<p>Empowered by AI algorithms and ML enhancements, data science promises to bring about a revolution in the construction industry, improving quality considerably and saving money.</p>

<p>Whether you’re just starting out in construction or have been in the industry for years, consider these benefits and elements of customer portal solutions when evaluating your options.</p>
<h2>What Is Customer Portal Software</h2>
<p>Being a central hub service, portal software is the place where your customer or partner can get information and interact with your construction company.</p>
<blockquote><p>Among the processes that such technology can handle, clients can find answers to their questions, learn more information about services, manage transactions, and track their orders. In their turn, your employees can rely on automated tools to handle various processes within customer support management.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are many different types of customer and partner portal software available to construction companies today. They can range from password-protected websites that give customers a direct line to customer service representatives to complex, comprehensive platforms that integrate with accounting and project management systems.

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25294 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elements-of-Customer-Portal-Software-for-Construction.jpg" alt="Elements of Customer Portal Software for Construction" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elements-of-Customer-Portal-Software-for-Construction.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elements-of-Customer-Portal-Software-for-Construction-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elements-of-Customer-Portal-Software-for-Construction-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elements-of-Customer-Portal-Software-for-Construction-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>Why Does Your Construction Company Need Customer and Partner Portal Solutions?</h2>
<p>If you’re running a construction company, chances are you know how tough it can be to manage projects. Between field reports, employee communications, invoicing clients, and more, construction managers often find themselves stuck in an email abyss.</p>
<p>Many construction project managers report spending most of their time on email-related tasks — leaving precious little time to actually keep projects on track.</p>
<p>That’s where customer portal service comes in handy, handling such routine tasks and leaving your employees time for business-critical and strategic tasks.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Client Portal Service</h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Greater automation of key customer-related processes</b>. With a portal service, you can handle most of the routine processes in your communication with clients automatically, including answering their questions, billing, and handling support tickets. This means you don’t have to spend as much time and energy on just basic customer interactions; instead, you can spend more time on growing relationships with your customers. Customers also benefit from portal software because they can often do all these things directly from a web browser without having to ask anyone or wait for an email response.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>More convenience for customers</b>. The majority of customers are willing to pay for portal software since it allows them to stay informed about their home or building throughout construction. By providing customers with a way to track and stay in touch with contractors, designers, and architects, you’ll be providing a valuable service that will keep them happy.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Faster and more effective communication</b>. Portal software helps your employees to address all your clients’ requests timely, even in the circumstances of heavy workload.  It will be quite easy to track each task – you are going to know what each specialist is doing at any time; if he or she works with other customers as well.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cost-effective customer management</b>. In the long run, client portal software can save money for your construction business. Being an automated assistant that improves communication with clients at each step, the technology leaves more customers satisfied after the interaction with your service and lets your workers bring more value to their work.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Build an Effective Portal Software for Customers and Partners?</h2>
<p>The most important first step to providing a portal service is your construction company website. It needs to have every piece of information that is needed by potential customers in one place, easy to find, easy to follow, and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Also, everything on your site should be accurate and up-to-date so that when potential customers look at it they can trust what they are reading.</p>
<p>On its basis, you ask your tech partner to create the client portal software with these 10 elements.</p>
<h3>Essential Elements of Client Portal Solutions</h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Dashboard</b>. It’s a default page that provides an overview of the entire software functionality. Most customer portal software allows you to customize what data displays on your dashboard by adding widgets to it. Widgets are basically mini-applications that display real-time information or allow you to take action, such as updating your account or adding new contacts.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>FAQ. </b>This section helps to streamline specific customer questions instead of sending them off to another department. By picking the right questions and answering them clearly, you can build trust with your customers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Knowledge base</b>. This is the place where clients can find all information related to products, services, requests, or answers given by specialists. It’s important to add this section to raise the credibility of your company.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Documents</b>. Customers should be able to view, upload, and download documents to your portal service. This way, you will keep all the information in one place and make it accessible to all the key stakeholders. As a partner portal service, the solution will make it easier to find all the relevant information for a particular case or project. Also, there should also be a search function that allows customers to find specific documents.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Ticket managing system</b>. As the key element of partner portal solutions, this feature allows to manage customer requests through tickets and track them as they’re being resolved. If done right, such a solution will help handle all incoming requests in an organized manner so that you can focus on completing your projects on time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Secure messaging</b>. Customer safety should be a top concern for customer portal solutions of any type. To ensure secure messaging, we recommend using SSL to encrypt communications between parties; however, even with encrypted communications, it’s important to have a third-party authentication system to make sure that users are who they say they are. Webmail can be used as an authentication platform if you already use a secure email provider for your business needs.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Integrations with other apps</b>. With this feature, the solution will serve as a central hub for business process automation. In such partner portal software, you can collaborate on projects, share blueprints and plans, track progress, schedule field visits and quality audits, request additional materials or resources from vendors or suppliers, and much more. Some applications even offer advanced data visualization tools to analyze large volumes of client data in seconds.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Analytics</b>. With portal software, you can get an extra source of information to gather analytics. By seeing not only who visits your website but what exactly they did in your software, you get valuable data for crafting a plan to attract more potential customers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Community forum</b>. It’s a great idea to provide a place for your visitors to speak with each other, share ideas, ask questions and make comments on client portal solutions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Construction analytics is one of the most powerful ways to accelerate project planning and its management challenges. According to Deloitte, the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/advisory/solutions/construction-analytics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major factors that impact</a> the process and outcomes in the construction industry include repetitive reporting, bunches of paper documentation, lack of system connectivity and optimization, unprioritized and unorganized data, and many more.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25242 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Analytics-and-Reporting.jpg" alt="Construction Analytics and Reporting" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Analytics-and-Reporting.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Analytics-and-Reporting-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Analytics-and-Reporting-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Analytics-and-Reporting-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>However, the innovative technologies of construction reporting and predictive analytics in construction can significantly optimize the project planning and execution, enhance collaboration and boost the company’s performance while eliminating the project spendings and time needed for its successful delivery.</p>
<p>In this article, Intellectsoft explains the importance of the construction data analytics software, the major benefits these technologies can provide for your organization, and how to create the most effective construction software for analytics and reporting.</p>
<h2>What Is Construction Analytics &amp; Reporting Software?</h2>
<p>Construction analytics is the process of data collecting, analysis, and management that is focused on improving the capital project outcomes, reducing risks, and uncovering critical information with the use of real-time data, taken from different resources and automated construction reports.</p>
<p>For construction organizations, the data analysis enables simplifying the entire construction process by interpreting and combining the financial and corporate data, project schedules and deadlines, and other essential elements, which is critical for successful construction management in general.</p>
<p>With the powerful construction analytics software, building companies can significantly automate the core processes in a project’s construction management, enhance the analysis of critical data, and turn it into cost-efficient, sustainable, and actionable results.</p>
<h2>Data Analytics in Construction: Major Use Cases</h2>
<p>There is a wide range of different options where construction reporting software is used today. First of all, real-time data access and automated reporting help building companies to improve the construction planning efficiency by simultaneously tracking dozens of different cost types (including labor, materials, equipment, and many more).</p>
<p>So, instead of hiring several specialists to track different financial data, you can entrust the cost analysis process to the software and access the comprehensive, accurate financial data anytime and from anywhere.</p>
<p>Secondly, the pre-made data analytics documentation can greatly streamline the workflow and upgrade the data work. Company’s departments and customers no longer need to request information regarding billing, payments, costs, and jobs – they can easily access data they are authorized to.</p>
<p>Additionally, out-of-the-box reports are too limited and can not always fit your business. For this purpose, instead of manually creating and maintaining the reports in Excel, it’s better to automate this process by using the specific construction analytics software that is designed to generate accurate and informative reportings within a few clicks.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25154 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Manager.jpg" alt="Construction Trends Manager" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Manager.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Manager-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Manager-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Manager-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Construction Contracts</h3>
<p>Blockchain technologies have already been revolutionizing the cryptocurrency market and are now going far beyond this scope, particularly by entering the construction industry.</p>
<p>If you’ve already done some research, you might know about their ability to create, verify and audit contracts in real-time between companies from any part of the world without third-party authentication.</p>
<p>These qualities allow construction companies to get the latest updates about what’s happening on their construction sites, as well as uncover the details of who has sent and received, completed, or approved a certain action.</p>
<p>One of the most helpful construction industry trends that will only increase their popularity in the upcoming years is the smart contracts – an automatic self-executing contract between the commissioner and the construction employees or companies providing the specific services or goods.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional paper processes, the construction contracts are able to optimize the numerous time-consuming processes such as, for instance, payment applications, as well as enhance productivity, speed up project and payment timelines and, of course, reduce the overall project costs.</p>
<p>So, with this technology implemented, companies now can streamline the straightforward two-party agreements as well as organize and manage the project’s schedule and resources with automatic updates, payments, and orders. Thus, both sides can win.</p>
<h3>Building Information Modeling (BIM)</h3>
<p>Building information modeling, also known as BIM, refers to the advanced software modeling technology that is used by architects, engineers, and contractors to collaborate on a project’s design, construction, and operation throughout its lifespan.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional drawing processes, the BIM software can not only create the realistic model of a building but also:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Store the detailed information of all the critical building’s properties</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Conduct intelligent project analysis in real-time</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Inform about the problems caused by the project changes</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Enable working on a different view of the same project model (for instance, from the architecture to engineering structure of the project)</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the building information modeling can help to address the changes in a building structure if those cause certain problems within the project construction, and help to work on a different aspect of the same model.</p>
<p>Additionally, this construction industry software can optimize numerous construction processes with the use of 3D technologies, uncover new automation opportunities, get detailed risk evaluation, and, finally, improve scheduling efficiency.</p>
<p>BIM is considered to be one of the most important construction industry trends in the upcoming decade, as it allows close collaboration between contractors and the construction workers from the concept and design modeling to the building construction and operation.</p>
<p>This technology has the highest rate of impact on the construction industry (over 19%) among the top 10 trends and innovations, <a href="https://www.startus-insights.com/innovators-guide/top-10-construction-industry-trends-innovations-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to StartUs Insights</a>. Needless to say, the world’s most famous extraordinary architecture projects created so far would not have been possible without implementing the building information modeling approach in the construction industry.</p>

<h3>Construction Safety Management System</h3>
<p>Safety management system, also known as SMS, is one of the emerging construction industry trends that can greatly maximize the key workflow processes and interact with the important forms, documentations, reportings, and other critical operational information directly to the job site in digital format.</p>
<p>Thus, there’s no need for the employees to visit a centralized office to fill out the paperwork, run the reports and handle the critical documents the employees need the most.</p>
<p>Basically, the construction safety software acts as a centralized hub that stores all the documentation, licenses, and certificates needed to conduct various company operations.</p>
<p>Additionally, this platform can be also utilized as a convenient communication tool that enables efficient coordination of managers, foremen, and worksite laborers with one another remotely, regardless of their location.</p>
<p>Moreover, most of the SMS software solutions are designed for different devices, which means the important information can be accessed anytime and from nearly anywhere.</p>
<p>Some other important qualities of SMS are faster troubleshooting, more effective employee training, and the ability to create a safety-focused work culture.</p>
<p>The obvious advantages of time-saving and workflow optimization make the safety management system software one of the most powerful construction trends that can take your company or organization to a completely new level of development.</p>
<h3>Construction Robotics</h3>
<p>So far the construction industry was one of the least automated industries that utilize manual-intensive labor as a primary source of productivity. However, though the robots do not currently participate in the major stages of a building’s life cycle, there is still a high possibility to change this in the upcoming few years.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25149 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Construction-Site.jpg" alt="Construction Trends Construction Site" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Construction-Site.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Construction-Site-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Construction-Site-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Construction-Site-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The StartUp Insights reported about the high potential of construction robotics, which features a notable impact (up to 17%) on the overall industry development. In other words, being a highly automated field, the future of construction industry is poised for the robot revolution.</p>
<p>As for the time of writing, there are several large robotic projects under development, but it’s still uncertain when they’ll be fully ready for deployment: most of the construction tasks are notoriously difficult to automate.</p>
<p>However, there are still a few types of construction robots that are poised to break into the construction market at a mass scale:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">3D Printing Robots. One of the most popular construction trends that are highly employed in the various modeling processes and aimed at building large projects on-demand. This technology has been already used in the Netherlands, where the first-ever <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2021/07/19/mx3d-3d-printed-bridge-stainless-steel-amsterdam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12-meter 3D printed bridge</a> for pedestrians and cyclists was built.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Brick-Laying &amp; Masonry Robots. These robots are aimed to speed up the process of construction work without losing quality.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Demolition robots. Another frequently used type of robotic technology used today is demolition robots, the core advantages of which are their high safety and cheaper labor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though robotics are still in their early stages of development, you can now make use of the various software solutions they employ to enhance the various construction processes, like task optimization and automation, 3D modeling, and more.</p>
<h2>Average Costs for Construction Software Development</h2>
<p>Overall, there are two major ways on how companies can employ the construction industry trends: using ready-to-go software solutions or else developing their own technology that features all the critical characteristics needed for setting up an effective workflow.</p>
<p>To reduce the construction software spendings and get the full stack of the critical features, more and more companies start developing their own technological solutions instead of paying hundreds of dollars on a monthly or yearly basis.</p>
<p>The vast majority of construction companies should expect to pay from $10,000 to $50,000 on average on software that provides all the essential characteristics needed to perform various project management, financial, and human resources functions.</p>
<p>In most cases, being aware of the new trends in construction, professional software developers can also help to save up the development costs by offering and embedding only the most effective features your company really needs to enhance its performance.</p>

<p>Here, we’ll elaborate on the key features and challenges for developing construction project management software, one of the most effective technologies that help project managers work efficiently.</p>
<h2>Project Management in Construction: Main Challenges</h2>
<p>The main problems for project managers working in the construction industry are related to time and money.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-construction-productivity-imperative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to McKinsey</a>, almost every construction project exceeds its initial budget, and more than two-thirds of them come later as expected. In the given circumstances, each tiny obstacle on the way leads to the great failure of the whole project.</p></blockquote>
<p>The specific list of challenges includes these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Disregard of short-term risks</b>. In practice, most delays come as a result of inadequate risk management. Usually, they are caused by over-optimistic subcontractor expectations and unexpected twists in stakeholders’ tastes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lack of clear targeting</b>. Most construction projects suffer from unstable structuring, meaning poor goal setting and/or weak performance management. As a result, most projects lose on the way because handle with numerous unimportant tactical aims that lack a strategic understanding.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Miscommunication</b>. The more people are involved, the easier it is to lose track of the project. Also, the lack of a unified communication platform causes the situation when the pieces of critical information are dispersed among various chats, and some people remain uninformed and make poor decisions that affect the project delivery.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Poor forecasting</b>. Project managers tend to set too high expectations, as well as clients and key stakeholders. As a result, people involved in the project set unachievable goals that are bound to fail. Moreover, it’s not always possible to consider extra factors and harmonize the opposing view within the project, which is also bad for the project&#8217;s effectiveness.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cash flow delays</b>. When the project needs new money inputs, it is not that easy to find investment. But even if you have an extra budget, it’s likely you won’t get it on time due to complicated accounting and outdated invoicing.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Hazard management</b>. Construction is the sphere connected with numerous safety threats, and not every project provides accurate site-specific safety management plans to address this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Software abilities include efficiently dealing with high-risk materials, tracking overall asset performance, and optimizing the supplier base. The ultimate goal is to optimize your business&#8217;s overall cost of quality, letting you connect and cooperate with suppliers who offer the best services for the most affordable price.</p>
<p>Also, the software provides all the tools needed to document your inspection process. This contributes to the transparency and standardization of common quality checks.</p>
<p>With the technology, you can rest assured all the activities result in the quantifiable goal you’ve set for inspections. In short, the software enables shifting from manual inspections done for the process’ sake to the standardized sequence of steps taken to guarantee you’ve reached your quality-related goals.</p>
<h2>Inspection Management Software Benefits</h2>
<p>Here, we’ll reveal the set of exact advantages inspection management systems will bring to your business right after installation.</p>
<h3>Better Planning</h3>
<p>Among all, the installation of inspection management software enables optimization of your resources.

<p>In practice, it means effective scheduling of inspections, not leaving all QC inspections for the last minute. Besides, the technology provides user-friendly dashboards that let you make adjustments in real-time without exchanging numerous Excel sheets.</p>
<h3>Sticking to the Process</h3>
<p>In terms of property management, inspection software reveals its best in creating standardized inspection checklists that guarantee accurate completion of all the performance stages.</p>
<p>In practice, it results in transparency and high quality of the problem detection and its prevention in the future. What’s more, you can create defect lists and specifications checklists in the program to facilitate your communication with suppliers and establish the common quality standard you both can rely on.</p>
<h3>Training Inspectors</h3>
<p>With inspection software, you get the set of standardized practices and action lists you new inspectors can use and learn from. This way, you won’t need an audit from external inspectors — your employees have all the tools needed to complete the key processes. Moreover, you can evaluate their quality and knowledge during the coaching sessions.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24460 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inspection-Management-Software-Engineer.jpg" alt="Inspection Management Software Engineer" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inspection-Management-Software-Engineer.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inspection-Management-Software-Engineer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inspection-Management-Software-Engineer-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inspection-Management-Software-Engineer-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inspection-Management-Software-Engineer-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<h3>Accelerating Inspections</h3>
<p>The software will let you automate the inspection process. In essence, this program will serve as a centralized solution that eliminates the need for manual work.</p>
<p>You can access all the critical documents from any device and even without an Internet connection. In addition, the software can process Big Data and scan regulatory documents faster. These enhancements result in speeding up your daily inspections and introducing more accurate compliance with rules and regulations.</p>
<p>The inspection management software limits the number of actions needed to the minimum, letting your business achieve the desired quality-related results faster and hassle-free.</p>
<h3>Instant Access</h3>
<p>Inspection management software collects all the relevant information in one place. This advantage leads to various improvements.</p>
<p>Your inspectors get a user-friendly dashboard with assigned inspections that already contain all the relevant checklists and standards in the task description. While dealing with time-sensitive information, you can react to current and potential problems in real-time. This minimizes the chance of making a severe mistake that was noticed too late.</p>
<p>Besides, the software itself serves as document storage that is more cost-effective than any other tool. In particular, it will let you collect and easily access all the papers that previously required spending a tremendous amount of resources in terms of time, logistics, and sticking to bureaucratic procedures. From now, you will reach any record needed within a couple of clicks.</p>

<h2>What Is ERP Software?</h2>
<p>In essence, ERP software, or enterprise resource planning, is a high-tech way to cope with basic business processes. Specifically, it assists in integrating several parts of the business within a single system interface that is easy to use and manage.</p>
<p>When it comes to ERP software for construction companies, the technology serves the same needs that refer to the industrial tasks.</p>
<h2>Why Is ERP Software Important?</h2>
<p>When it comes to exact applications of ERP software in resource planning, through a single interface, it facilitates processes as such:</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Controlling sales,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Making marketing activities,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Financial management,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">HR management.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this context, ERP for construction serves as a glue uniting several corporate processes and computing systems in one place. Simply put, it lets you see everything happening in your company fast and accurately and communicate with the departments on the real and transparent data you can both refer to.</p>

<h2>What Are the Applications of ERP Software for the Construction Industry?</h2>
<p>Here are several most popular ways to ERP system for a construction company:</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Operational management.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among all, the construction ERP software is highly useful for optimizing the costs and workload in your company. In this context, resource planning in construction management can be more effective and successful, thanks to the accurate tracking and reporting incorporated in the technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>With ERP software, you get a high-level instrument to control your expenses and accumulate your profit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other applications include managing general contractors and subcontractors, finances, accounting, supply chain management, and operations. In practice, businesses in the industry use the technology for monitoring, automation, and optimizing processes. This helps to increase the effectiveness of the work and check if the results are consistently successful.</p>
