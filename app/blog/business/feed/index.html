										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/web-application-and-api-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner </a>defines the web application market as an environment that is continuously evolving, incorporating new technologies and increasing safety standards.</p>
<p>In this regard, the proper attention to the foundational design of a web app contributes to maintaining the required robustness, responsiveness, and security of this software. In a web app, this is what solid web app architecture is responsible for.</p>
<p>Web application architecture refers to the way in which the various software components of a web application interact with each other and the hardware they run on.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25118 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Web-application-architecture-team.jpg" alt="Web application architecture team" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Web-application-architecture-team.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Web-application-architecture-team-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Web-application-architecture-team-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Web-application-architecture-team-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>This article will provide an overview of modern web application architecture, including its key components, types, and models so that you can invest in this type of architecture with confidence.</p>
<h2>What Is Web Application Architecture?</h2>
<p>The definition of web app architecture is broad and depends on the focus of building web applications. Technically, it’s the skeleton of a web app, including its elements, databases, systems, servers, interfaces, and all the communication happening between them. In more abstract terms, it indicates the logic behind responses to client and server requests.</p>
<p>When it comes to business benefits, web application architecture refers to the process of creating web applications and planning for their needs in terms of speed, scalability, and security.</p>
<p>In short, web app architecture refers to how web applications are structured and how they’re deployed on a server. As opposed to most desktop software, which users download and install, an Internet-based service must operate seamlessly over HTTP.</p>
<h2>Why Is Web App Architecture Important?</h2>
<p><b>Ensure customer satisfaction:</b> Investing in web application architecture, or a solid blueprint of its functioning, is needed from the standpoint of user experience.</p>
<p>Being an important part of developing any web app, it makes sure your design is efficient and scalable, which means it will work well under a variety of conditions and avoid downtime. Otherwise, a business app will irritate users with numerous bugs and turn them away from cooperating with it.</p>
<p><b>Greater business results:</b> The right web application architecture can save your company time and money over the long term, making sure that your website operates at its optimal capacity and runs smoothly without any problems.</p>
<p>In particular, web app architecture allows web developers to create websites that scale well as traffic increases; it also provides features such as offline access (e.g., Google Docs) that are increasingly expected by today’s consumers.</p>
<p><b>Better app performance:</b> A solid web app architecture introduces a great degree of flexibility, meaning its adaptiveness to dynamic market fluctuations and customer demands.</p>
<p>The vision on the overall structure makes it easier for developers to work on an app in several modules and introduce new features without interrupting the web app’s work.</p>
<p><b>Improved app security:</b> By envisioning a web app as the system of several blocks, modern web application architecture protects each of its structural elements separately.</p>
<p>This way, overall security increases, making the software stand all the common safety threats like malicious attacks. Thanks to the solid structure, adding new elements won’t ruin the achieved security level.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25116 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme.jpeg" alt="web app architecture scheme" width="921" height="548" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme.jpeg 921w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme-300x179.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme-768x457.jpeg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme-600x357.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme-450x268.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px" /></p>
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>The exact way how web application architecture operates differs between projects, as many of its aspects aren’t dictated by technology but by your project’s needs and business objectives. In other words, web app elements can be adjusted or changed entirely without affecting the overall success of your web app.</p>
<p>At the same time, the typical process of communicating with web app architecture is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">You as a client type an URL in the relevant browser field.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The browser sends the request to the Domain Name Server to recognize the IP address.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If successful, the browser sends a request to the server to respond.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The server directs the request to the data storage to locate the page, request data display.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If successful, the initially requested data appears in your browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this web application architecture diagram, you can see 3 main sides of the process:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Client-side, or the frontend for user interaction</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Database server, or an extra component for sending client’s data to the server</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Server-side, or the backend storing business logic, processing requests, and sending responses</li>
</ul>
<p>Correspondingly, there exist 3 web application architecture layers:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Presentation layer</b>: The place with static content and dynamic elements that assist interaction between users and browsers. Programming this layer requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as it stands for the app’s frontend.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Data layer (Data Access and Data Service): </b>The Data Access layer is closely linked with the business layer as it gets needed information from the servers. In this environment, there can also be serverless cloud platforms like MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle RDBMS, Redis. In its turn, the Data Service layer separates business logic from the client-side while processing requests.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Business layer</b>: The web app’s backend that determines business logic and responses to browser requests that are sent to the presentation layer. The programming languages include Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby, and the environment contains servers, IaaS, PaaS, or serverless cloud platforms.</li>
</ol>
<p>All the layers work independently and communicate with each other through the relevant components.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25115 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle.png" alt="web app architecture request response cycle" width="1001" height="721" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle.png 1001w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle-300x216.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle-768x553.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle-600x432.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle-450x324.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" /></p>
<h2>Web Application Architecture Components</h2>
<p>The applications differ in complexity and functionality, and the number of layers and components changes accordingly. It may happen that an app is so simple that it works as a monolith storing all the web app architecture in one place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a typical web app will consist of multiple components (or tiers) that interact with each other. Usually, the two major groups for web application architecture are user interface and structural web components.</p>
<h3>User Interface Components</h3>
<p>This group of components composes a visual interface and has no ties to the architecture itself. Being a part of the interface layout design, the set of UI components includes activity logs, dashboards with analytics, and notifications.</p>
<h3>Structural Web Components</h3>
<p><b>Client components</b>: The frontend part that appears in the browser and serves as the field to interact with a web application. The client components are developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and don’t need an operating system or device connectivity to operate. Simply put, these components are the web app representation.</p>
<p><b>Server components</b>: The backend part of the web application architecture that is built using Java, Python, .Net, NodeJS, PHP, and Ruby on Rails to create app logic. Also, server components compose the database, meaning a control center for data storage.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25119 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram.png" alt="web application deployment diagram" width="809" height="587" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram.png 809w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram-300x218.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram-768x557.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram-600x435.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram-450x327.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></p>
<h2>Models of Web Applications</h2>
<p>Web application architecture models differ based on two criteria: the number of servers and the number of databases. To pick the best one, you should carefully revise your aims and constraints and find the most appropriate one for the current stage of business development.</p>
<h3>One Web Server, One Database Model</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The simplest</b>: You have only one server and one database for all the requests and responses.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relatively unreliable</b>: If the single server goes down, your app will shut down immediately.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relevant for testing</b>: These days, one web server, one database model is too old for real apps. However, it’s a great way to test your web app idea and overview the fundamental design of your web app as an MVP.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multiple Web Servers, One Database Model</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Stateless architecture</b>: There is no single web server for data storage. When a client inputs information, the relevant server writes it to the sole database managed outside.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relatively reliable</b>: As there are more than two servers in the model, a backup server is always available.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>One database availability</b>: Dangerous in terms of possible website crash.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multiple Web Servers, Multiple Databases Model</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The most efficient</b>: No single point of failure, as there are several web servers and databases.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility</b>: You have at least two options for database storage, so you can choose to keep identical data in all of them or distribute information.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Some information can be lost</b>: In the case of a crash, you won’t lose your entire web app. Nevertheless, some data will be lost. To prevent this scenario from happening, it’s better to install load balancers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Web Application Architecture</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25114 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-1024x563.png" alt="Progressive Web Apps" width="1024" height="563" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-1024x563.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-300x165.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-768x423.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-1536x845.png 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-2048x1127.png 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-600x330.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-450x248.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-1000x550.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>A web application architecture type is a particular pattern under which the components interact with each other. In other words, it shows the way app logic lets the client side and server side communicate.</p>
<p>To make the right choice here, it’s also relevant to check your business requirements, along with technical information about features, functionalities, and the desired app logic.</p>
<h3>Single Page Application Architecture</h3>
<p>This web application architecture is designed to show relevant content only. To make this happen, it first loads the relevant web page and then dynamically updates the representation of its content with the requested information only.</p>
<p>In other words, it doesn’t refer to the server for loading new pages but sends requests for the needed parts of the webpage only.</p>
<p>Single Page Applications contribute to smoother performance and a more intuitive user experience.</p>
<h3>Microservice Architecture</h3>
<p>Being the frequent alternative to an unreliable monolithic web application architecture, microservices disperse the functionality to deliver small and lightweight services separately.</p>
<p>In particular, they are loosely coupled and use APIs for communication if a sophisticated business problem arises. This peculiarity eases the developer’s life since it’s possible for individual service components to be built in different programming languages.</p>
<p>Thanks to its flexibility and stability, microservice architecture has gained popularity these days, with businesses like Amazon, eBay, and Netflix adopting it for their complex needs.</p>
<h3>Serverless Architecture</h3>
<p>In this web application architecture type, you outsource both server and infrastructure management to a third-party cloud service provider. This way, a web app logic execution won’t intervene in the infrastructure running.</p>
<p>Choosing a serverless architecture is good for companies that want to delegate server and hardware management to a reliable tech partner and concentrate on front-end development tasks instead.</p>
<p>Also, this web application architecture type allows working on small functions in apps. The service providers that assist in server management are Amazon and Microsoft, among others.</p>
<h3>Progressive Web Apps</h3>
<p>Being among the most promising web app trends <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/us/en/blog-list/2019/doubling-down-on-our-progressive-web-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2019</a>, progressive web apps offer a convenient and effective user experience available from any browser and device through a shared URL.</p>
<p>The application of progressive web apps is wide, including industries like entertainment, finance, and <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/progressive-web-apps-for-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eCommerce</a>. Their key benefits include lightweight, cost-effectiveness, cross-device nature, ability to attract web traffic, and a fully functioning app experience.</p>
<h2>Web Application Architecture: Best Practices and Tips</h2>
<p>Here, we’ve gathered the top 5 recommendations for business owners to consider while working on web app architecture for their projects and building cooperation with tech partners.</p>
<h3>1. Think of a proper web application architecture at the earliest stages</h3>
<p>Without a comprehensive structure, your application will turn into a labyrinth of messy elements and components that are too hard to handle.</p>
<h3>2. Don’t copy somebody’s success</h3>
<p>The top mistake is to pick a web application architecture of a successful company and simply replicate it. In reality, a successful architecture is one that corresponds with your business goals and ideas, not theirs.</p>
<h3>3. Pay attention to your technical limitations</h3>
<p>It’s not always possible to get the best and most successful elements in your web application architecture. However, with the proper attention to quality attributes and realistic business expectations, you will get the maximum from all the components you have.</p>
<h3>4. Eliminate the problems right away</h3>
<p>Don’t wait for the web app release to fix the problems in its architecture. The earlier you address the issues, the more reliable core features it will have.</p>
<h3>5. Create a checklist of successful web app features</h3>
<p>To make sure your web app has achieved its goal, it’s good practice to note your expectations from it at the very beginning and discuss their possibility and measurable KPIs with your tech partner.</p>
<p>The possible checklist may include these features:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Overall system flexibility</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Components can be reused</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Well-written code</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Ability to scale</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">System stability</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Easy bug detection</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Sticking to security standards</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Fields to work with user feedback</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">No crashes</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Easy-to-use</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Responds fast</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Can be deployed automatically</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The COVID-19 outbreak has severely changed the development vector of different industries throughout the world, and the banking industry is not an exception.</p>
<p>The financial institutions are now looking for opportunities to quickly implement various banking industry trends and digital solutions that will help them to transform their current business model, enhance the efficiency of the operations and improve competitiveness on the banking market as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-22899 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Buildings.jpg" alt="Banking Industry Trends Buildings" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Buildings.jpg 1280w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Buildings-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Buildings-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Buildings-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Buildings-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Buildings-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Buildings-1000x666.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>According to Deloitte’s recent research, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/US164678_CFS-banking-and-capital-markets-outlook/DI_CFS-banking-and-capital-markets-outlook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these changes</a> in the banking industry have opened up new focus areas for the businesses, such as cybersecurity, advanced analytics, robotic process automation, cloud computing, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>Moreover, around 84% of banking institutions consider AI solutions as one of the main priorities for improving their competitiveness in the current industry market</p></blockquote>
<p>In this article, Intellectsoft will explain what emerging trends in banking will be popular in the upcoming years and what benefits they can actually bring to your business in 2022.</p>
<h2>Banking Industry Trends to Keep an Eye On in 2022</h2>
<p>This is one of the latest banking technology trends that will even keep picking up the pace. The pandemic forced brick-and-mortar banks to reduce their working hours or temporarily close branches until everything settles down.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>More and more banks provide their services without having a physical branch. The only thing clients need to do is to use their preferred device to open a bank account and use their finances.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a cost- and time-saving solution for both banks and clients and the competition has already started extending.</p>
<p>Such an approach grants uncomparable flexibility and, what’s even most important for clients, digital-only banks offer their services at lower rates as there is no need to maintain a brick-and-mortar branch so this is a real threat to traditional banks.</p>
<h3>1. White Label e-Wallet</h3>
<p>The pandemic has stimulated users to try a new format of payments they’d like to use further – digital wallets. In general, that’s a contactless form of mobile banking that enables completing the transaction anytime and from nearly any iOS or Android device.</p>
<p>At the same time, it allows businesses to provide a <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/personalization-in-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personalized customer experience</a> while eliminating the high costs and time for developing the system from a scratch.</p>
<p>According to the predictions of Allied Market Research, around 4 billion people will be using digital wallets as the main payment method by 2024, so such digital banking trends are simply a must for the institutions that want to be at the top amongst competitors.</p>

<h3>2. Self-Service Applications</h3>
<p>One of the most valuable online banking technology trends, especially for millennial banking is self-service apps. Basically, they enable customers to make a list of financial transactions such as deposit or withdrawal, inquiry, transfer, bill payment, loan, currency exchange, and lots of other wealth management directly in their in-app profile.</p>
<p>At the same time, various businesses within the banking industry can improve client engagement, optimize and automate most of the services that are currently offered on the banking market.</p>
<p>Thus, clients no more need a physical presence to conduct any sort of banking transactions: all these are already included in their banking app!</p>
<h3>3. Cross-Platform Services</h3>
<p>In fact, transactions are closely involved in other industries such as healthcare, insurance, hospitality and retail banking. That is why embedding cross-platform payment methods, such as mobile payments or hybrid wallets can significantly raise the income of the businesses and financial institutions they’re cooperating with.</p>
<p>A notable example of the utilization of cross-platform services is the Payment Program of the WeChat app in China. The embedded payment in-app services allow businesses and entrepreneurs to quickly conduct the transaction within a few seconds while not compromising the application security.</p>
<p>Moreover, this digital banking trend is much easier and faster to launch and maintain, and is between 15% to 50% more cost-effective compared to the native apps!</p>
<h3>4. API Implementation</h3>
<p>In the banking industry, API or Application Programming Interface enables synchronization, linking, and connection of the database of service with any application. It works as a so-called bridge that ensures the secure transmission of personal information without involving third parties.</p>
<p>At the same time, the API trend in commercial banking and private banking makes these financial institutions more transparent and secure, which surely is a great benefit for businesses, their clients, and of course, the financial institutions themselves.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-22903 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Mobile.jpg" alt="Banking-Industry-Trends-Mobile" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Mobile.jpg 1280w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Mobile-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Mobile-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Mobile-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Mobile-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Mobile-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Mobile-1000x666.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>The other great advantages of the API banking trend implementation are the cost reduction and increased income, workflow optimization, and eliminated time for transactions completion as well. Thus API implementation is among the top banking trends for 2022.</p>
<h3>5. Video Banking</h3>
<p>Another emerging banking trend is video banking technology – a great opportunity to enhance the workflow by optimizing the remote services for their clients. Such an approach provides a better engagement of customers with their financial institutions and enables the online processing of different in-person procedures.</p>
<p>This banking trend is especially beneficial for investment banking and consumer banking. Moreover, this enables bank specialists to be always available at the exact time the customer needs, so the bank doesn’t always need to be local to the client.</p>
<p>Thus, video banking can optimize the various banking processes to provide as smooth and effective client service as possible. At the same time, workflow optimization and automation allow financial institutions to reduce the time and costs needed to process any client request.</p>
<h3>6. Online and Mobile Banking Experience</h3>
<p>Online and mobile banking experience is already common as it’s extremely convenient for most people. In fact, in spring 2020 many banks experienced a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/27/coronavirus-crisis-mobile-banking-surge-is-a-shift-likely-to-stick.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200% rise</a> in mobile app registrations.</p>
<p>Respectively, it resulted in a declined number of physical branch visits as self-service automation enables clients to perform many actions on their own.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-22900 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Contactless.jpg" alt="Banking Industry Trends Contactless" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Contactless.jpg 1280w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Contactless-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Contactless-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Contactless-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Contactless-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Contactless-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Contactless-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>However, it’s worth noting that, at the same time, the demand for an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/banking-industry-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded range of mobile banking features</a> is growing exponentially.</p>
<blockquote><p>Users are expecting to completely substitute their cards with an app and use it when withdrawing cash in ATMs, put a temporary hold on a card, use facial recognition or scan fingerprints when entering the app, view spending statistics, cancel service subscription payments, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s crucial to understand and satisfy these needs for retaining the existing clients and attracting new ones.</p>
<h3>7. Open Banking Gains Traction</h3>
<p>Such an increased interest in online and <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/what-is-digital-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile banking</a> has contributed to the advent of new financial innovation called Open Banking.</p>
<p>A growing number of countries worldwide are planning to implement Open Banking initiatives and leverage the enormous potential of APIs. This is a perfect way to achieve a connected holistic banking experience for clients.</p>
<p>Basically, this technology will enable clients to easily consolidate and access their financial data from multiple institutions and organizations through open API for a seamless and impeccable experience.</p>
<p>The adoption of this technology will lead to Open Finance that makes it possible for third-party providers to access clients’ financial data after their consent.</p>
<h3>8. Contactless Payment Methods Over Cash</h3>
<p>The latest crisis has significantly impacted people’s lifestyles and has formed new behavior patterns. With the reduction of real-life interactions, people opt for online transactions and digital payment methods.</p>
<p>Some countries even expect the complete abolishment of cash and switching to solely digital financial transactions. In its turn, such a transition of banks to a cashless society will reduce costs related to handling hard money.</p>
<p>It will be much easier for banks to analyze digital transactions and get an overview of clients’ expenditure patterns.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-22902 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Digital.jpg" alt="Banking Industry Trends Digital" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Digital.jpg 1280w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Digital-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Digital-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Digital-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Digital-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Digital-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Digital-1000x666.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<h3>9. Artificial Intelligence for Increased Personalization</h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence is being implemented in many industries and the banking sector will broadly utilize this game-changer to increase clients’ personalization and overall service use convenience.</p>
<p><i>AI and<a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/machine-learning-in-financial-fraud-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> machine learning</a> will be actively used to provide clients with real-time tailored financial recommendations to ensure a smooth experience.</i></p>
<p>In addition, this innovative technology will help banks to predict clients’ behavior, perform risk management, reduce fraud, identify banking technology trends, and analyze the competition.</p>
<h3>10. Shift to Composable Architecture</h3>
<p>Many banks are predicted to switch to composable architecture to let them effectively respond to potential challenges and crises in the future.</p>
<p>The transition can be done step-by-step and it is a perfect agile and scalable solution for financial organizations that will help optimize many internal processes.</p>
<p>This is why broad investment in the transition to composable architecture is a banking trend for the future year.</p>
<h3>11. More Complex Cloud Environment</h3>
<p>From now on, banks and financial organizations are starting to create more complex cloud environments and actively benefit from the enormous potential of cloud computing technologies for efficient remote operations.</p>
<p>Such organizations have to process a huge amount of data on a daily basis and making the information easily accessible will be possible only with the increased use of cloud computing.</p>
<p>This solution is very scalable and cost-efficient and most financial institutions are predicted to embrace this innovation in their favor.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-22898 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Analytics.jpg" alt="Banking Industry Trends Analytics" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Analytics.jpg 1280w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Analytics-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Analytics-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Analytics-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Analytics-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Analytics-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Banking-Industry-Trends-Analytics-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<h3>12. Robotic Process Automation for Higher Efficiency</h3>
<p>Robotic Process Automation or simple RPA is another hot banking trend that institutions will try to adopt for increased productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p><i>This solution can significantly save the budget and substitute or assist human employees with a wide range of tasks to minimize error, maximize accuracy, and significantly improve clients’ experience.</i></p>
<p>Companies of all sizes invest to leverage this amazing solution that soon will rock the world of banking.</p>
<h3>13. Focus on Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>Taking into account that most transactions and financial operations are processed online, companies will pay extra attention to their cybersecurity to protect all the sensitive data and ensure the highest security level of clients’ financial information.</p>
<p>Such data is an easy target for hackers so to avoid financial loss and reputational damage, cybersecurity has to be a top priority for all industry players.</p>
<h2>Summing It Up</h2>
<p>As the situation with coronavirus spreading remains uncertain and the crisis continues, no one knows exactly when the dust is going to settle.</p>
<p>Companies might still encounter new challenges, opportunities, and discoveries so it’s mandatory to keep a close eye on the situation, monitor the market, and focus on customers’ behavior to quickly adapt to arising circumstances.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24935 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ERP-Software-Development-Usage.jpg" alt="ERP Software Development Usage" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ERP-Software-Development-Usage.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ERP-Software-Development-Usage-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ERP-Software-Development-Usage-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ERP-Software-Development-Usage-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the ways to enhance the efficiency of a company is to employ enterprise resource planning (ERP). For businesses of different sizes, the enterprise resource planning system helps to overcome operational challenges, provide better efficiency of the services, and correspond to the needs of the modern market.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this post, we’ll provide a detailed overview of ERP software solutions, including their types, business benefits, and implementation peculiarities.</p>
<h2>What Is ERP and What Is It Used For?</h2>
<p><b>Enterprise resource planning (ERP)</b> is a modular software solution that centralizes the organization’s information, optimizes connections, and facilitates data sharing between departments of the enterprise. With its help, a company can establish end-to-end connectivity of all the running business operations, including the relations with vendors and customers.</p>
<p>The ERP system brings together multiple modules and facilitates cooperation between various departments of the company. This way, distinct business units can constantly communicate, interact, and share data while dealing with daily operations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even more, the ERP system stores all the relevant information and enables automation of collecting and using corporate data for the business’s benefit. In this regard, ERP systems harmonize the decentralized workflow that usually adds some hurdles to process management.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What Industries and Businesses Can Use ERP System?  <b> </b></h2>
<p>ERP is suitable for various industries and will bring business benefits to companies of any size. Thanks to technologies implemented for impeccable connectivity between different organizations, ERP is in great demand in these industries:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Construction</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Manufacturing and Distribution</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Healthcare</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Professional Services</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hospitality</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Agriculture and Farming</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Retail</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Technology and Electronics</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Food and Beverage</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Education</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Nonprofit Organizations</li>
</ul>
<p>ERP systems assist companies consisting of several departments and business units. Usually, cooperation between even two departments in such businesses requires completing several actions and spending a lot of time.</p>
<p>With enterprise resource planning, such departments can enter the databases of other business units to find the required information. That’s how ERP facilitates work and saves businesses time and money.</p>
<h3>The list of tasks enterprise resource planning covers includes:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">human resources</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">bills</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">expense management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">purchase orders</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">project management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">invoicing</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">stock management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">quotes</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">asset management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">API access</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">payment gateways</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">dashboards</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">detailed reports</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">employee training information, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Are the Types of ERP Systems?</h2>
<p>Over the years of deployment, ERP systems have developed and grown in their number. Nowadays, they can be classified according to the implementation process and a number of functions.</p>
<h3>Types of ERP (by Implementation)</h3>
<p>Nowadays, there are three types of ERP classified by implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">On-premise (for large companies)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Cloud ERP (for small companies)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hybrid (for developing companies)</li>
</ul>
<h4>1. On-Premise ERP System</h4>
<blockquote><p><i>On-premise software requires in-house installation and maintenance, meaning its availability in the organization’s computers and the presence of an internal IT team.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>There is no need for an Internet connection to get access to the information stored on-premises. Servers are owned by the company, and an IT team takes care of the software and constantly updates it. Large corporations can consider this type of ERP software implementation, as having a license for the program means having control over every module and aspect.</p>
<h4>2. Cloud-Based ERP System</h4>
<blockquote><p><i>Companies can purchase </i><i>cloud ERP</i><i> from third-party vendors on a monthly or annual basis. It grants access to the data anytime and anywhere via an Internet connection. </i></p></blockquote>
<p>There is no need to employ IT specialists, as cloud ERP will be maintained by the vendor. That’s why it’s important to find a reliable tech partner. Generally, this software type is cheaper than the on-premise one and suits the needs of small businesses more.</p>
<h4>3. Hybrid ERP Systems</h4>
<blockquote><p><i>Hybrid ERP is a combination of on-premise </i><i>ERP </i><i>and cloud-based </i><i>ERP</i><i>. It perfectly suits the needs of companies that occupy a specialized niche.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The cost of hybrid enterprise resource planning maintenance depends on its sophistication. Usually, businesses turn to a hybrid ERP system when they need to integrate cloud-based modules into existing on-premise software as they grow. So, data is split into two parts between on-premises and on-cloud.</p>
<h3>Types of ERP (by Number of Functions)</h3>
<p>Depending on the business size, ERP systems vary in terms of functions for:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Small business</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Mid-market</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Enterprise</li>
</ul>
<h4>1. Small Business ERP</h4>
<p>Small businesses usually specialize in one particular field, so the number of daily operations is rather low and there is no need to purchase an ERP full-package suit. The best option is to choose a specialized system that will have basic modules to suit your business requirements.</p>
<p>The best fit for small businesses is cloud-based ERP with a basic set of tools. It’s cheaper to maintain, doesn’t require an in-house IT team, and is a good start for future growth.</p>
<p><b>Examples of </b><b>ERP systems</b><b> for small businesses</b>: Acumatica, Sage, Oracle NetSuite.</p>
<h4>2. Mid Market ERP</h4>
<p>Mid-size companies have to automate a larger number of operations to enhance service efficiency. While the need for customization is minimal, cloud-based software is worth considering. In this scenario, companies can customize the number of functions and request assistance from a server provider to implement them.</p>
<p><b>Examples of </b><b>ERP systems</b><b> for mid-market</b>: Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle NetSuite, Oracle JD Edwards.</p>
<h4>3. Enterprise ERP</h4>
<p>Large enterprises should consider on-premise or hybrid ERP systems, as their software should be generic and have a wide range of modules. The combination of two enterprise resource planning software types lets to connect corporate departments and share information with remote branches.</p>
<p><b>Examples of </b><b>ERP systems</b><b> for enterprises</b>: Oracle ERP Cloud, Oracle JD Edwards, SAP, Microsoft Dynamics.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-24934 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ERP-Software-Development-Team.jpg" alt="ERP Software Development Team" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ERP-Software-Development-Team.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ERP-Software-Development-Team-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ERP-Software-Development-Team-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ERP-Software-Development-Team-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h2>
<h2>Business Benefits of ERP Systems</h2>
<p>Enterprise resource planning is a multifunctional software tool that adds value to a business in a number of ways, including cost savings, improved efficiency, enhanced collaboration, and optimized customer and partner management.</p>
<p>The exact list of advantages includes:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Unified system for all processes and business operations</b>: The software allows you to automate business processes and stores all the data and records in one place that is available across all departments of the company.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cost reduction</b>: The software saves money on administrative and operational processes as it proactively manages and streamlines automated operations.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Customer satisfaction</b>: As the processes are automated, they run smoothly and allow timely delivery.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility</b>: ERP systems suit digital transformation and help you adjust to future trends.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Profound data analysis</b>: Analytical data reports will help your business respond to market trends and conditions faster.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Competitiveness</b>: ERP is a powerful tool in terms of compliance, agility, and ability to expand, thus helping you to occupy the top positions in the industry.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, ERP increases productivity and efficiency; introduces interconnection between various departments, suppliers, vendors, and outsourcers; and provides storage for data-driven insights.</p>
<p>As for the possible limitations of ERP solutions, companies should be ready to address these three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Prices</b>: You’ll need to cover the expenses on ERP consultants, server providers, in-house IT specialists, and software implementation.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Maintenance</b>: As technologies develop, the system should be constantly updated and enhanced in order to maintain the level of compatibility of the company.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Training and Education</b>: You should show your employees how to use the system and notify departments about new tools and functions added.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Does an Enterprise Resource Planning System Work?</h2>
<p>ERP systems combine a number of modules and sub-modules that are interconnected and distinguished by serving a particular business area. Each module contains several sub-modules or tools that manage different tasks and projects. Combined together, modules cover all organizational operations, both internal and external.</p>
<p>Usually, each ERP task is collaborative, meaning that employees from different departments can be added to manage and complete the request on time.</p>
<p>For instance, if a customer contacts you to buy your product, a system will add a new order that notifies all the departments involved. These workers can see it and start to work on their part of the request. Meanwhile, all the updates added to the request are saved, so employees have up-to-date information.</p>
<h3>Main Components of ERP Solutions</h3>
<p>Usually, ERP systems consist of Human Resources, Sales, Finance, Logistics, and Inventory modules. Other modules can be added to the system if your organization has specific needs and wants to automate certain operations.</p>
<h4>Core ERP Components:</h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Human Resources</b>: This module handles employee management tasks such as enrollment, offboarding, timesheets, and benefits administration. HR component can automate payments calculation, thus reducing human error and time spent on monotonous tasks.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Customer Relationships Management:</b> CRM module stores and stacks generated customer and lead data, including customer buying habits. It will help you lead successful ads and store customer payment information.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Business Intelligence</b>: This module helps to solve issues related to data collection, analysis, and report delivery.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Supply Chain Management</b>: The component that optimizes distribution and manufacturing operations and creates a flawless supply chain.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Inventory Management System</b>: This ERP element keeps track of all the inventory of the company and automatically updates your website for the customers to know whether some products are out of stock. It is especially useful for organizations in the manufacturing field and the ones owning distribution centers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Financial Management</b>: This component analyzes and keeps track of the financial data of the company. It helps to control the enterprise’s budget, spent costs, and received payments.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Additional ERP Components:</h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Marketing Resource Management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Event Management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Advanced Planning System</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Sales-Order Management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Risk Management</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other components can be added to the system per your requirements. The main issue here is to have a team of employees who are capable of creating and integrating new functions.</p>
<h3>Core Features of an ERP System</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Centralized database</b>: This feature is needed to comprise the data flow from all the corporate departments and store it in one place.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Modular</b>: The system consists of a number of interconnected modules.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexible</b>: The system can be upgraded according to the company’s needs by replacing functions or tools or adding new modules.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Automated</b>: The main ERP purpose is to automate manual processes and omit duplication of the information.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Time and cost-effective</b>: As the system automates operations, it saves time spent on a product or facility delivery as well as reduces costs.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the end of 2021, the worldwide market value of IT services the companies delegate to the IT outsourcing vendors is expected to reach over $413.72 billion, <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/963932/it-outsourcing-services-revenue-in-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Statista</a>. And, the IT outsourcing trend will only increase in the upcoming years, with an annual increase of about 5% each year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24879 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team.jpg" alt="IT Outsourcing Failures Team" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-450x253.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Another thing companies should consider is a huge tech talent shortage trend that has been fueling the tech industry in recent years. Basically, these are the core factors that enhanced outsourcing the IT services and dedicated developers by various tech companies and IT organizations.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll talk about the common problems of outsourcing, its main failures, and the most effective practices of how they can be avoided.</p>
<p>It’s time to start!</p>
<h2>Why Outsourcing Fails?</h2>
<p>Along with implementing the evolving technologies, it becomes more challenging for the companies to develop the whole spectrum of innovative software solutions directly in-house. That is why companies try to build an effective strategy of hiring a dedicated team of developers using the outsourcing approach.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, it’s not that easy as it seems: according to Deloitte, “<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-how-much-disruption.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsourcing as a concept</a> is changing from making it run to making the change happen”.</p></blockquote>
<p>This means you have not only to implement this system but also get the benefits of its performance, as well as successfully resolve the possible issues you will encounter in the process. For instance, the most frequent problems of outsourcing can include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">insufficient communication between the organization and outsourcing vendors</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">the lack of trust with the outsourcing providers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">low expertise in optimizations and improvements</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">inadequate risk evaluation and wrong development strategy</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">the irresponsibility of outsourced staff</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>In fact, these are only a few issues that can result in multiple outsourcing failures of any organization. However, if you still think these are only the minor problems of outsourcing that can’t impact the overall situation, the following <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2020/08/02/vanguard--infosys-are-now-billion-dollar-outsourcing-partners-good-bad--risky/?sh=36dbb8c52672" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistics from Forbes</a> may change your mind: up to 25% of all outsourcing corporations fall within 2 years, and around 50% can fail within 5 years of relationships.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, let’s look closer at the potential IT outsourcing failures your company should be aware of to succeed.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-24878 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-Success.jpg" alt="IT Outsourcing Failures Team Success" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-Success.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-Success-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-Success-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-Success-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h2>
<h2>Common IT Outsourcing Failures Your Company Might Encounter</h2>
<p>After we know why outsourcing fails, it’s time to analyze the potential issues you might face when implementing the outsourcing model into your business. As a part of our discussion, you’ll also learn more from the outsourcing failures examples of the world’s largest companies!</p>
<h3>#1 Neglecting the Needs of Your Target Audience</h3>
<p>Modern software development is all about delivering the best tech solutions that fully surpass consumer expectations. That is why any sort of product should be customer-centric and provide the most relevant features that resolve specific problems of your target audience. Otherwise, you’re at risk of failing to recoup the financial investments.</p>
<p>One of these outsourcing examples was Subbxi &#8211; a tool for generating the subtitles, that has not been published on AppStore after its release. The problem was that the client hasn’t done the research to ensure the app will find its audience.</p>
<p>How to avoid this failure: This IT outsourcing failure can be avoided if the customer-centric basics are strongly baked into the project, always targeted during the planning processes, and clearly outlined in the documentation.</p>
<p>This way you can not only improve the quality and performance of your IT product but also clear out what you expect to get with your product, and why these are important.</p>
<h3>#2 Insufficient Communication</h3>
<p>The next thing to consider is establishing the communication channels you’ll use to reach the IT outsourcing providers. In fact, the lack of communication can significantly impact the quality of the final software product and cause a list of issues that need additional inputs, which consequently lead to additional expenses on the IT services.</p>
<p>That is why it’s not enough to only implement outsourcing services to your business. More critical is to always track the progress and timely initiate the changes in the process of developing.</p>
<p>How to avoid this failure: To prevent this outsourcing failure, <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/blog-remote-development-team-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">define the communication channels</a> and the frequency of the QA sessions in advance, and also employ the person in charge of the project’s development. The project lead should be the exact mediator between your company and the outsourcing team and be ready to resolve all the issues.</p>
<h3>#3 Lack of Clarity</h3>
<p>One of the most popular IT outsourcing failures to avoid is the lack of clarity when planning the project and its actual development.</p>
<p>Remember, the outsourcing team will focus on the project documentation when creating the tech product. And, if the outline doesn’t have the clear requirements and instructions of what you expect in the result, you’re likely to get the product that needs further improvements.</p>
<p>How to avoid this failure: To prevent project delays and overpaying for the additional work of your IT outsourcing team, it’s better to state out the clear requirements, goals, and features your product should include. This trick can minimize possible errors and improve the process of software development.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24875 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Employees.jpg" alt="IT Outsourcing Failures Employees" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Employees.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Employees-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Employees-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Employees-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>#4 Poor Planning</h3>
<p>Another common issue of outsourcing failures you might encounter is insufficient planning &#8211; a more global problem if compared with lack of clarity. Poor planning can impact not only the projects your developers are entrusted to create but also the entire process of coworking with your outsourced team.</p>
<p>How to avoid this failure: The detailed analysis of the outsourcing examples has shown that considering the detailed performance of your IT outsourcing team at each stage of the product development is one of the core things to succeed.</p>
<p>For instance, you can start by clearing out the time frames, who and how the progress will be evaluated, as well as the various workflow organization aspects like developing tools, specific requirements, and approaches that are to be used in the process.</p>
<h3>#5 Low Quality of Tech Expertise and Inadequate Outsourcing Price</h3>
<p>Before the start of any project, it’s essential to find out more about the expertise of <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/outsourcing-software-development-to-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your offshore development team</a>. If neglected, this can result in the waste of your time, efforts, and resources needed to get this staff onboarded and when you’ve finally understood that’s not the vendor you want to work with, you need to start all this process all over again.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what happened with the MarketingHelpNet company, which hired an offshore web designer who didn’t possess the required web design skills for creating the functional product, and as a result, the project failed.</p>
<p>How to avoid this failure: Before contracting the vendors, it’s essential to check the references and technical instructions your developers are going to work with. Additionally, to ensure you’ll choose the experienced tech talents for your project, it’s important to research the vendors at a reasonable price and research the case studies before signing the contract.</p>
<h2>Guide to Hiring the Best Tech Talents</h2>
<p>Having analyzed the major outsourcing failures, let’s now briefly summarize how to find the best talents in the tech industry:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Build an MVP first to estimate the project value</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Compare different providers, the services they offer, and their prices</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Provide a clear understanding of your product from top to bottom</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Pay attention to the project planning and processes organization</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Set up the realistic deadlines</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Build reliable communication and stay in touch with your developers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Focus on value over cost, since it may impact the final product performance</li>
</ul>
<p>With having all these points considered, you’ll certainly succeed in hiring the best IT outsourcing vendors for your business.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mainly, this growth is caused by the global rise of the wholesale vertical, including eCommerce and retail, especially after the pandemic hit in 2020 when nearly all the eCommerce businesses have experienced a huge rise in sales and revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>At present, it becomes even more obvious: the industry requires more and more innovative digital solutions targeted at business automation and further sales increase.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24698 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ecommerce-Order-Management-Software-Porcess.jpg" alt="Ecommerce Order Management Software Process" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ecommerce-Order-Management-Software-Porcess.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ecommerce-Order-Management-Software-Porcess-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ecommerce-Order-Management-Software-Porcess-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ecommerce-Order-Management-Software-Porcess-450x301.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>One of the newest efficient solutions for eCommerce is implementing order management software. This technology not only allows automating the core online business processes but also reduces the manual options for order management.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explain what order management software is, its essential features and benefits, and how it can improve your business performance from day one. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2>What Is an Order Management System in eCommerce and Retail?</h2>
<p>In eCommerce, the order management system (OMS) refers to the software for securely processing client orders across every step of their journeys in an efficient yet cost-effective manner. In other words, it allows delivering the perfect customer services across the brand’s various sales funnels.</p>
<blockquote><p>With this technology, operators can effectively manage the orders coming from multiple eCommerce channels at a time and use the advanced sale order processing technologies for online orders fulfillment.</p></blockquote>
<p>For instance, it covers the processes of order routing, shipping label printing, order returns, subscription management, and more &#8211; all those that used to be handled via manual updating.</p>
<p>In general, eCommerce order management is responsible for effective product delivery from the time customers add it to the shopping cart till they have received the delivery. Though this process is adapted individually to the specific business needs, the common steps of eCommerce order management process flow consists of the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">eCommerce company receives the order receipt from a customer</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The company sales manager enters the order details into the system</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The customer gets a notification regarding the order processing</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The order is transferred to the eCommerce warehouse/order fulfillment center</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The products are packed and prepared for the shipping</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The order is shipped according to the information on the shipping labels</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The customer receives the order status notification: shipped</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The order is delivered due to the preferable address or postal service</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of handling all these steps in a separate system and manually filling in the order status data, the order management system allows unifying these processes within a single order fulfillment system to ensure efficient order processing and product delivery.</p>

<h2>Does an eCommerce Business Really Need Order Management Software?</h2>
<p>The eCommerce order management software is a must-have technology for both small retail businesses and large eCommerce companies.</p>
<blockquote><p>First of all, it facilitates the order fulfillment process by making it much more streamlined, cost-efficient yet automated. This software minimizes the time needed to prepare the order for shipping.</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides, it optimizes the overall time needed to deliver the order to your customer, which has a direct impact on the customer experience.</p>
<p>At the same time, the final consumers get up-to-date information about the order status, are less likely to ask for any order information in customer support service, and are way more loyal towards the service: it has a transparent order processing system that clearly states the order delivery info.</p>
<p>For businesses, implementing the order management system allows them to automate and upgrade the key order completion processes. Some types of OMS software even enable tracking the order shipping by integrating with the carrier’s system like FedEx or DHL until the order is delivered.</p>
<h2>Main Advantages of Order Management Solutions Implementation</h2>
<p>Now that you know what the eCommerce order management software is and whether it’s worth using for retail businesses. Here, we’ll uncover the core benefits of this technology implementation, and whether or not it corresponds to your business developing strategy.</p>
<h3>Improves the Delivery Speed</h3>
<p>The most critical benefit of the eCommerce order management software is the faster order delivery, which can have a huge impact on the overall customer experience.</p>
<p>According to McKinsey, in recent times <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Travel%20Transport%20and%20Logistics/Our%20Insights/Same%20day%20delivery%20the%20next%20evolutionary%20step%20in%20parcel%20logistics/Sameday_delivery_The_next_evolutionary_step_in_parcel_logistics.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the speed of delivery</a> has become equally important to the product price, which makes it an important aspect of building the business competitiveness. In times of a same-day or two-day delivery, consumers simply don’t want to go back to weeks and months of waiting.</p>
<p>That’s where the order management system for eCommerce comes into play: a single order management system can significantly eliminate the time needed for order processing and delivery.</p>
<h3>Eliminates the Human Error</h3>
<p>With having multiple order management systems for different stages of order fulfilment, it often happens that the worker filled in the wrong data or has chosen a wrong product article when processing the large orders, or else — didn’t send the order invoice to the client. As a result, the eCommerce platform has a poor customer experience and low customer loyalty rate.</p>
<p>The Salesforce research has shown that <a href="https://c1.sfdcstatic.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/research/salesforce-state-of-the-connected-customer-4th-ed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 89% of customers</a> are more likely to make another purchase after a positive customer service experience.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24696 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ecommerce-Order-Management-Software-Buyer.jpg" alt="Ecommerce Order Management Software Buyer" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ecommerce-Order-Management-Software-Buyer.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ecommerce-Order-Management-Software-Buyer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ecommerce-Order-Management-Software-Buyer-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Ecommerce-Order-Management-Software-Buyer-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The eCommerce order management solutions allow eliminating human errors with automated order processing. In other words, the lesser the workload, the fewer steps a manager needs to fulfill, the better quality of the services the business will perform as a result.</p>
<h3>Enhances the Business Scalability</h3>
<p>The eCommerce order management can grow and develop along with your business, and result in a feature-rich omnichannel system. Such management software can be successfully used for multiple platforms and different products and is able to keep the pace and scale along with your business growth.</p>
<h3>Enables the Multichannel Management Opportunities</h3>
<p>Last but not least, to stay competitive in any eCommerce scope, it’s important to develop an online presence at different sales platforms. For instance, it’s a great opportunity to enhance the business performance with the eCommerce website, popular retail platforms, and social media.</p>
<p>At the same time, with having the orders flow from Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, and Amazon, it becomes more challenging to track the orders and fulfill them in time.</p>
<p>eCommerce order management software is the right technology for ensuring high-grade customer service for any sales channel yet tracking all the orders within a single system. With the developed order management system, you can also generate the reporting and analyze the sales trends to build a strong and effective business strategy.</p>
<h2>Core Features of eCommerce Order Management Software</h2>

<h2>Benefits of Front Desk Management Software for Hotels</h2>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24628 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Lobby.jpg" alt="Hotel Front Desk Management Software Lobby" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Lobby.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Lobby-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Lobby-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Lobby-450x253.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Here are the essential benefits you’ll get using the front desk software for hotel:</p>
<h3>Reduce the Front Desk Workload</h3>
<p>One of the core ideas of the front desk at a hotel is to provide high-quality services for the customers. The front desk staff is responsible for check-ins and check-outs, room management, customer service, and other important hotel staff information updates. The huge workload caused by these and plenty of other factors could directly impact the quality of the customer service.</p>
<p>The front desk software for hotels allows automating the key processes of the hotel management and effectively performing the time- and labor-consuming tasks, thus providing more opportunities for improving the customer service.</p>
<h3>Enhance the Teamwork</h3>
<p>When managing a large hospitality institution, it becomes more challenging to operate the hotel staff, keep them informed about the updates and assign new tasks or duties. With the hotel front desk software solution, all the employees can access their profile, review and prioritize all the tasks, and effectively run their duties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this technology allows creating a single communication system that saves up hours of time needed for arranging the meetings or individually informing the hotel staff on demand: reach any of the hotel workers online!</p>
<h3>Get a Clearer Improvement Strategy</h3>
<p>Another great thing about the front desk software for hotels is the ability to get accurate data regarding the hospitality business performance, define the strong sides and weak points for further hotel service improvement.</p>
<p>The detailed analytics and multiple research tools allow getting the full information regarding the most popular hotel services (restaurant, gym, spa, cleaning or travel guides, breakfast, cleaning, transportation, etc), the most favorable booking dates (holiday seasons, weekends, or celebrations) and more.</p>
<p>It also helps to define the most common client pains and which services should be improved or removed (especially the unprofitable ones), which can certainly improve the overall hotel performance.</p>
<h3>Improve the Guests’ Experience</h3>
<p>Multiple investigations in client service have shown that leveraging hotel front desk software big data can save up to 670 working hours per year! By reducing the workload of the hotel’s front desk (calls and guests requests automation, online reservations, and advanced hotel staff management), your employees have more time and resources for interaction with your clients and providing better services.</p>
<p>At present, clients highly pay attention to the service quality, so it becomes even easier to turn the one-time visitors into loyal guests of your hotel.</p>
<h3>Increase the Business Profitability</h3>
<p>Last but not least, the hotel front desk management system is a perfect software that allows enhancing business profitability by automating key management processes.</p>
<p>You’ll save up on labor and improve the individual KPI of your hotel staff, optimize the key front desk tasks and boost the customer experience, which consequently <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/hotel-revenue-management-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results in higher revenue rates</a>. So, what exact features do you need to look for in the best front desk software for your hotel?</p>
<h2>Main Features to Include in a Front Desk Management Software</h2>
<p>Hotel front desk software is much more than a simple management tool, as it includes all the necessary features needed to automate and optimize the key management processes of any hospitality unit.</p>
<p>Developing this type of management system is one of the best approaches to incorporate the most critical features your business requires for workflow automation and services improvement.</p>
<p>Let’s now uncover the most essential features a hotel unit certainly should include in its front desk management solution.</p>
<h3>Reservation and Booking Management</h3>
<p>The front desk system accumulates all the booking information from different channels and conducts a real-time checking of these channels to ensure the proper reservation tracking.</p>
<p>This software can accurately inform about the total number of apartments booked and ready to move in, calculates the most popular booking dates, and provides a detailed overview of the visitors’ reservation trends.</p>
<p>At the same time, it allows users to process the deposits and check the reservation status in real-time, thus optimizing the workload of the reception desk.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24627 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Guest.jpg" alt="Hotel Front Desk Management Software Guest" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Guest.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Guest-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Guest-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Guest-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Check-in and Check-out Control</h3>
<p>The other feature that reduces the hotel staff workload and enhances hotel management is the automated check-in and check-out system. With this option, the front desk employees can quickly process the customer flow and update the apartment information within a single tool.</p>
<p>Hotel guests can feel the difference in the service speed: their visits will be processed up to 5 times quicker than using the standard system. Additionally, hotel staff can effortlessly track room service, prioritize the tasks, and fulfill all the clients’ requests according to the front desk data input.</p>
<h3>Automated Guest ID Registration</h3>
<p>To guarantee the clients’ privacy yet optimize the registration speed, it’s a great option to allow users to manually upload the ID documents for their quick and safe processing. The guests’ ID, as well as all the other important information, can be <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/big-data-in-hospitality-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stored in the hotel database</a> and retrieved later on-demand (mostly, when it’s needed to process the booking requests from the same client).</p>
<h3>Automated Communication Methods</h3>
<p>In the digital era, nearly all the interaction between the clients and the service vendors comes through online services: chatbots, emails, specific notifications, and more.</p>
<p>It’s much more convenient, faster, and doesn’t require direct communication with the front desk staff. According to several pieces of research, people mostly prefer texting methods of communication, and less use the direct interactions (which is exceptionally important in the post-pandemic times): it’s quicker and more convenient.</p>
<p>By including multiple methods of communication, you can not only enhance the time needed to process the clients’ requests but also reduce the front desk workload as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24630 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Room.jpg" alt="Hotel Front Desk Management Software Room" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Room.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Room-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Room-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Room-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Hotel Services Management</h3>
<p>If your hospitality unit offers different types of services for the clients’ use, it’s a great idea to include these services management into your front desk at a hotel.</p>
<p>This way, front desk workers can easily update the price and availability information for each service, add the discounts and promo codes, and even analyze the trends of the hotel service use. This data gives additional directories on how to improve the existing hotel features as well as the general guests’ preferences: restaurants, cleaning, sports, and more.</p>
<h3>Room Cleaning and Housekeeping</h3>
<p>It’s also critical to create a single system that every staff member can make use of, especially the housekeepers. By accessing the front desk management system, they can quickly review and update the information regarding the room and its supplies, as well as the room availability status for the next booking.</p>
<h3>Other Great Tools for Front Desk Hotel Software</h3>
<p>To make the most of your front desk at the hotel, it’s also important to include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Tracking calendars &#8211; allows checking the up-to-date reservation information and avoid double bookings</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Reporting tools &#8211; assists in analyzing the occupancy level, <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/a-simple-guide-to-hotel-inventory-management-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotel inventory</a>, and sales to provide the critical insights needed for the profitability improvement</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Notification systems &#8211; the different channels created for both hotel staff and guests enable quick yet effective updating of the room service status, check-in or check-out information, upcoming events that might be useful for guests, and more.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Team management &#8211; allows administrating, assigning, and supervising different tasks and track their status within a single software system.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The construction industry is one of the hardest areas for effective project management. Normally, it deals with sophisticated tasks and numerous stakeholders involved, which makes timely and accurate delivery of project aims very hard to achieve.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24592 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Project-Management-Software-Process.jpg" alt="Construction Project Management Software Process" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Project-Management-Software-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Project-Management-Software-Process-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Project-Management-Software-Process-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Project-Management-Software-Process-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In the given circumstances, project managers are in constant search of effective tools that will provide the needed level of optimization and accuracy and help them achieve both tactical and strategic construction goals.</p>
<p>Among various technologies, construction industry practitioners can choose the system designed for their particular needs. Project managers have such a system too.</p>
<p>Here, we’ll elaborate on the key features and challenges for developing construction project management software, one of the most effective technologies that help project managers work efficiently.</p>
<h2>Project Management in Construction: Main Challenges</h2>
<p>The main problems for project managers working in the construction industry are related to time and money.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-construction-productivity-imperative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to McKinsey</a>, almost every construction project exceeds its initial budget, and more than two-thirds of them come later as expected. In the given circumstances, each tiny obstacle on the way leads to the great failure of the whole project.</p></blockquote>
<p>The specific list of challenges includes these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Disregard of short-term risks</b>. In practice, most delays come as a result of inadequate risk management. Usually, they are caused by over-optimistic subcontractor expectations and unexpected twists in stakeholders’ tastes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lack of clear targeting</b>. Most construction projects suffer from unstable structuring, meaning poor goal setting and/or weak performance management. As a result, most projects lose on the way because handle with numerous unimportant tactical aims that lack a strategic understanding.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Miscommunication</b>. The more people are involved, the easier it is to lose track of the project. Also, the lack of a unified communication platform causes the situation when the pieces of critical information are dispersed among various chats, and some people remain uninformed and make poor decisions that affect the project delivery.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Poor forecasting</b>. Project managers tend to set too high expectations, as well as clients and key stakeholders. As a result, people involved in the project set unachievable goals that are bound to fail. Moreover, it’s not always possible to consider extra factors and harmonize the opposing view within the project, which is also bad for the project&#8217;s effectiveness.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cash flow delays</b>. When the project needs new money inputs, it is not that easy to find investment. But even if you have an extra budget, it’s likely you won’t get it on time due to complicated accounting and outdated invoicing.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Hazard management</b>. Construction is the sphere connected with numerous safety threats, and not every project provides accurate site-specific safety management plans to address this problem.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given the circumstances of today’s working conditions, we can assume that remote work isn’t going anywhere any time soon. Thus, we need to determine whether outsourcing is limited to the realm of remote development or if product management can be outsourced as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24527 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Process" width="640" height="420" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process-600x394.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process-450x295.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Before, we were confident that it was possible to outsource everything except the product team. But after a time we began to wonder, why can’t product teams be remote too?</p>
<p>This article will discuss whether remote product management and development are realistic and consider both the pros and cons of each.</p>
<h2>Common Reasons for Outsourcing</h2>
<p>Every month at Intellectsoft, we speak with dozens of companies that are considering remote development. Most often, they fall into one of several categories:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Small to medium businesses that digitize a business model </b><b>with proven offline results</b>. In this case, the company has a working knowledge of how an online business should work. They simply bring existing business processes online.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Companies that scale up existing business processes.</b> This case includes all those who have built successful MVPs but are now thinking about scaling their success by adding more functionality to reach a larger audience.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Companies that are working on a one-time addition to existing functionality. </b>In such cases, it makes no sense to hire someone from the outside due to the irregular nature of the development work.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Businesses that plan to develop a solution from scratch.</b> Usually, these include companies that need a specific business solution and then long-term support. They do not intend to periodically change the product, conduct dozens of AB tests, and so on. Just building, deploying, and using is their purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recently, due to COVID-19, more and more companies are doing what was previously considered impossible. They are transitioning product and marketing development to remote.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-24529 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Manager" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h2>
<h2>Why Product Management Is Moving to Remote</h2>
<p>Both well-developed businesses and young startups have been resorting to outsourcing for product management. Some of the most common reasons for this include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lack of qualified human resources.</b> Often, teams don&#8217;t have enough in-house resources to test new products or research a new segment of users and do it right. This is where remote teams come in handy.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>They need new products or features urgently, and deadlines are on fire. </b>Imagine you’re a face mask production and the pandemic strikes. Now you want to quickly scale production and customer acquisition channels but don&#8217;t have enough workforce to do so. That’s when you don’t have time to hire and onboard new staff and need someone who can ship things right away.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Need solid product expertise for good money. </b>A company has no experience working with developers and product managers. They cannot spend a year and a half on acquiring expertise, hiring personnel, and developing it. In this case, it is better to turn to those who have sufficient expertise.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The current team is failing and product development needs to be accelerated. </b>If a company is willing to try a product-led growth model, the product manager has to be a seasoned professional. The current team may not be the best fit for the product-led growth philosophy or meet the new requirements for development speed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Critical Role of the Product Manager</h2>
<p>The position of a product manager has only been around for a short time. There are plenty of definitions of what a PM is. But for all of them, there is one that we can stick to. The product manager is the person responsible for creating and bringing a new product to market.</p>
<p>Suppose you look through hundreds of PM vacancies and conduct an in-depth analysis. Soon, it becomes clear that a product manager is a specialist who works at the intersection of business, marketing, and programming.</p>
<p>At every stage, they control the work on a new product, interact with investors and users, and develop their brainchild after the technical implementation.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the main task is to develop new products in line with trends and the needs of users. Beyond this, there are plenty of other responsibilities and fields of expertise for a PM:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Collecting information</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Deriving product requirements</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Creating a work plan and distributing roles among staff</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Promoting and selling the product</li>
</ul>
<p>Product manager&#8217;s top skills:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">market research and market analysis to determine the basic needs of customers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">implementation of product lines and testing new ideas</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">conducting competitive analysis, comparing similar products through numerous characteristics</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">development of marketing communications</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">liaising with the sales director to create a sales strategy</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">working with clients and the sales department to assess the results of implementation</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">formation of long-term and short-term sales forecasts, providing analytics to management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">introducing new products to the market, analyzing profitability (ROI)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">creating a marketing strategy with the marketers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">pricing based on market research, production costs, and expected demand</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">scheduling and defining operational requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a crucial role for any project. So why would a big company&#8217;s CEO outsource a product manager or an entire product team?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24528 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Discussion" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>Reasons for Outsourcing the Product Manager and Product Team</h2>
<p>Well, there are a couple of reasons to do so. First, you get world-class experts working on your product. These professionals usually take jobs for a limited period of time tied directly to KPIs or a set of other mission-critical objectives like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The number of conversions and sign-ups compared to the current performance.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Marginality. The actual sales are compared with the planned figures.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Active users. Evaluate how many people are using the product daily.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Customer Retention Rate (CRR). The retention rate of new users, which in most cases is even more critical than the acquisition.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">ROI. An indicator of the return on income tied to the cost of advertising. It shows whether the investment has paid off or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delivering these KPIs means that the remote project manager and their development team are responsible for more than just releasing new functionality. They are entirely responsible for achieving specific business goals.</p>
<p>Leading product development experts often command high salaries. Thus, hiring them as full-time in-house staff can be incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>Additionally, product design and prototyping equipment can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, not including the costs of maintenance and repair. Outsourced product development is often much less expensive than in-house design.</p>
<p>And in the end, you are not responsible for your outsourced product team. This is very useful if you are testing a product MVP based on market hypotheses. You can quickly terminate cooperation if the test was unsuccessful and the product-market fit was not found. Most outsourced product teams agree on that with their clients in advance.</p>
<h2>What Is the Future of Product Team Outsourcing?</h2>
<p>At Intellectsoft, we see a roughly 25% increase in clients wanting to include product managers and analysts as part of their outsourced teams.</p>
<p>Agile development methodology allows for one product specialist to work on 1-3 projects simultaneously, alternating the planning, prototyping, development, and analysis phases among themselves.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24526 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Office" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The only requirement for organizing a high-performing team of this level is the willingness of stakeholders to adhere to the process and agreed priorities. Remote product teams are capable of quick pivots, but only within extended sprints.</p>
<p>We anticipate that product management and analyst outsourcing will become more mainstream over the next three years in the wake of traditional marketing and development outsourcing.</p>
<p>As skilled specialist shortages and prices grow, availability and affordable prices will become critical factors in attracting these teams to an increasing number of players in the market.</p>
