Are these two roles similar?<\/p>\n<p>To understand what is the difference between software developer and software engineer yet be able to define which one will surely fit your software development project, it\u2019s essential to start with a detailed overview of the main responsibilities and tasks performed within each position.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, Intellectsoft\u2019s best experts will make a detailed overview of a software developer vs software engineer and explain how to select the professional who will work best for your business needs and purposes.<\/p>\n<h2>What Does a Software Engineer Do?<\/h2>\n<p>Simply put, a software engineer is a professional who applies the principles of software engineering for designing, developing, maintaining, testing and evaluating computer software.<\/p>\n<p>As a rule, this position implies strong teamwork with other project members, as the software engineer works with the separate components of the hardware system, works on creating the tools and solutions to develop the specific software, and also searches for potential opportunities to improve the software. Unlike software developers that work on a limited scale, software engineers resolve the issues on a much larger scale.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Having analyzed the global searching trends for \u201csoftware engineer\u201d, we can see that the interest in this position among <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=software%20developer,software%20engineer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s searchers shows<\/a><strong> 76 out of 100 points<\/strong>, which means this trend is still in the peak period of its popularity as of February 2022.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25368 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Office.jpg\" alt=\"Software Developer vs Software Engineer Office\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Office.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Office-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Office-450x300.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>What Does a Software Developer Do?<\/h2>\n<p>On the contrary, the software developer is the professional responsible for building cross-platform software for different types of devices. Typically, they write code from scratch, with the ready-to-go application at the output.<\/p>\n<p>The most common examples of this software are the diverse number of various desktop and mobile apps for different operating systems: the applications like Instagram, Facebook, Photoshop or MS Word are the ones that come to mind first.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the software engineer position, this job is primarily a solitary activity, so the developer works not on the separate program components but on the complete program structure overall.<\/p>\n<p>Software developers commonly utilize pre-made tools and frameworks to build the software. However, they have a much-limited scale of issue-resolving compared to the engineers.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=software%20developer,software%20engineer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s searching trends<\/a> for the term \u201csoftware developer\u201d are half as much as we\u2019ve got for the engineer position: as of February 2022, it shows only <strong>33 points out of 100<\/strong>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, this trend has never reached more than 50 points in the last 5 years, which only emphasizes that there is a huge difference between software engineering and software development processes.<\/p>\n<p>Does this mean the software engineer position is better than a software developer? Let\u2019s find this out by making a detailed comparison of software developers vs software engineers!<\/p>\n<h2>What Is the Difference Between Software Engineer and Software Developer?<\/h2>\n<p>Though both specializations refer to one scope of software development, in fact, software developer and software engineer occupations are not similar.

However, in case it\u2019s possible to use the premade development tools for your project \u2013 the software developer is your best option to choose!<\/p>\n<h3>#3 Will This Person Be Engaged in the Specific Development Stages or the Entire Process of Software Building?<\/h3>\n<p>If you want a professional that will participate in the entire process of the application development, it\u2019s also more beneficial to select the software developer instead of a software engineer, as this expert can effectively participate in each stage of software building yet features better creativity, which is surely great for any project.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, if you want the person to resolve some larger issues and the one that won\u2019t be required to contribute in every stage \u2013 choose a software engineer!<\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25371 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Team.jpg\" alt=\"Software Developer vs Software Engineer Team\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Team.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Team-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Team-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Team-450x300.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>#4 Will This Expert Operate on a Bigger Scale or Perform the Functions on a Small Scale Only?<\/h3>\n<p>If the upcoming project requires a person that operates the large-scale tasks, it\u2019s better to consider hiring a software engineer, and ultimately, when you want the professional to carry out the engineering functions on a smaller scale \u2013 it\u2019s more reasonable to choose a software developer!<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll probably want to hire a software engineer if your software project requires a person that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Features the ability to work in teams<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Has the advanced problem-solving skills<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Possesses strong interpersonal and communication skills<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Has expertise in computer programming and coding<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Is focused on the object-oriented design<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s better to consider hiring a software developer specialist if you\u2019re looking for the person that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Possesses advanced knowledge in cloud computing, data structure, and data algorithms<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Has the ability to learn and develop his or her skills<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Features Git and GitHub hard skills<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Knows the source code editors, can perform debugging, code refactoring and syntax highlighting<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Will complete the project alone (no teamwork needed)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you can see, having compared software developer vs software engineer, you can now understand which one will be the right option for your software development project.<\/p>\n<h2>Summing Up the \u200b\u200bDifference Between Software Developer and Software Engineer<\/h2>\n<p>Having compared the position of software developer vs software engineer, you can now clearly understand what is the difference between software engineer and software developer. Additionally, there are a few aspects to point out as well.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, these jobs are not similar, as they use different approaches and perform slightly different tasks for developing the software products: when a software engineer works on the separate app components within a team, the software developer alone employs the specific tools and frames to build the app from scratch.
