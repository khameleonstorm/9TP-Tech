When such banks modernize such systems, they replace older, less efficient systems with new technology that\u2019s designed to meet the business needs of the present and future.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25401 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-payment.jpg\" alt=\"Modernizing legacy systems in banking payment\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-payment.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-payment-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-payment-600x399.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-payment-450x300.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Older technologies may seem hard to modernize, but if you want to remain competitive, it\u2019s something you have to do. The good news is that with the right tools and a modern approach, you can successfully modernize your banking legacy systems without breaking anything else in the process. Here are some helpful tips on how to accomplish this feat.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a Legacy System in Banking?<\/h2>\n<p>In IT, a legacy system is an older computer system or application program that continues operating long after newer systems have been introduced. Newer systems are sometimes described as greenfield or brownfield systems, depending on whether they replace a working system or upgrade an older one.<\/p>\n<p>The term legacy comes from legacy code \u2014 the term for obsolete programs that continue operating as-is. As a rule of thumb, legacy code is 10 years old or more; most often it refers to internal accounting applications.<\/p>\n<p>In the banking sector, legacy systems include many of today\u2019s most popular banking apps, from online banking portals to mobile and desktop Internet-banking apps.<\/p>\n<p>Many of these systems have become unsustainable due to increasing demand for new features and improved user experiences, making it difficult for financial institutions (FIs) to service customers with ease and efficiency. That\u2019s why it\u2019s business-critical to modernize banking legacy systems.<\/p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25403 size-full\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-work.jpg\" alt=\"Modernizing legacy systems in banking work\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-work.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-work-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-work-600x399.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-work-450x300.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2>Why Do Legacy Systems in Banking Need Modernization?<\/h2>\n<p><b>Customer demands<\/b>. Among all, legacy banking systems make it hard to provide high-quality service to your clients. Mobile payments, instant interactions, secure data storage and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/personalization-in-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personalized banking<\/a> are just a few examples of what today\u2019s consumers demand from their banks. Frequently, legacy software simply cannot keep up with these demands.<\/p>\n<p><b>Maintenance cost<\/b>. Supporting legacy systems in their current state is time-consuming and costly. Frequently, companies turn to expert help for that. However, several updates can go a long way toward improving performance \u2014 even increasing speed and stability \u2014 without incurring an enormous cost. Modern technologies can even automate your strategic decisions without the need to maintain the separate department of data scientists to manage them.<\/p>\n<p><b>Need for innovation<\/b>.To remain competitive, sooner or later, each bank faces the need to update their legacy software. A modernized banking system can improve security and customer satisfaction while also reducing operating costs and risk exposure, which means solving numerous internal problems and serving customers better.<\/p>\n<h2>Main Benefits of Modernizing Banking Legacy Systems<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25415 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Benefits-of-Modernizing-Banking-Legacy-Systems-1024x593.png\" alt=\"Benefits of Modernizing Banking Legacy Systems\" width=\"1024\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Benefits-of-Modernizing-Banking-Legacy-Systems-1024x593.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Benefits-of-Modernizing-Banking-Legacy-Systems-300x174.png 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Benefits-of-Modernizing-Banking-Legacy-Systems-768x445.png 768w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Benefits-of-Modernizing-Banking-Legacy-Systems-600x347.png 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Benefits-of-Modernizing-Banking-Legacy-Systems-450x260.png 450w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Benefits-of-Modernizing-Banking-Legacy-Systems-1000x579.png 1000w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Benefits-of-Modernizing-Banking-Legacy-Systems.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Risk management<\/b>.

Although investing in modernization needs extra money, their maintenance and operation will be cheaper in the long run.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Best Practices and Tips for Legacy Software Modernization<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes time for a financial institution to consider updating a legacy system, many questions arise: How will we finance modernization? What is our exit strategy from our existing environment? Is our data at risk during implementation? When should we start planning for a project like modernization?<\/p>\n<p>Here is a collection of working approaches to answering these questions about modernizing legacy systems in banking.<\/p>\n<h3>Take Time on Preparation<\/h3>\n<p>First, understand how automation fits into your overall operations. While automating individual processes might seem like a good idea, it may not integrate well with other parts of your business. Thus, make sure you set clear goals for every automation project and create an implementation strategy that will work for you and last over time.<\/p>\n<p>To prepare for modernization, you need a plan that ensures process efficiency and takes advantage of current technology. You also need a realistic budget. If your bank is currently using an old application that\u2019s missing features and needs updating or repairing, you don\u2019t want that updated version causing more problems than it solves. It should be a strategic part of your business\u2019s growth plan.<\/p>\n<p>To get started, gather ideas on how customers interact with your bank \u2014 both in person and online \u2014 and jot down new processes you could introduce. For example, if customers are always waiting in line at one branch location on Thursdays after lunch, maybe they would appreciate a mobile app so they can do their banking from anywhere, anytime. After collecting all these ideas, you can start searching for a reliable tech provider who can help you with the needed modernization.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25399 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-employee.jpg\" alt=\"Modernizing legacy systems in banking employee\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-employee.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-employee-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-employee-600x399.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-employee-450x300.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Pick Your Tech Partner Wisely<\/h3>\n<p>While modernizing legacy systems in banking, it&#8217;s important to find a reliable tech vendor who can implement your ideas into reality. Be prepared for lots of questions about your system, and make sure you ask lots of questions, too\u2014it&#8217;s critical to understand just how complex and difficult your project will be in advance.<\/p>\n<p>Also, check the portfolio and technical capabilities of your future partner. It\u2019s best to research ahead of time what kind of projects they&#8217;ve worked on in their past. The more relevant experience they have, the better off you&#8217;ll be..<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/us\/Documents\/financial-services\/us-fsi-modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deloitte experts<\/a> also recommend focusing on business impact and total cost of ownership, not just technology features and purchase price. While talking to an IT company, remember that the best way to ensure that your legacy modernization efforts are successful is by focusing on business value \u2014 not just because it&#8217;s easier to measure, but also because it forces you to ask tougher questions. Take an active role in decision-making so that you end up prioritizing your project wisely and aligning it to your financial goals.<\/p>\n<h3>Guiding Principles to Updating Legacy Systems in Banking<\/h3>\n<p>While working on the project, stick to these 6 key principles from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/mckinsey-digital\/our-insights\/tech-forward\/how-banks-can-achieve-next-generation-legacy-modernization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McKinsey list <\/a>that contribute to successful modernization of legacy systems in banks:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Establish a flexible data platform<\/b>. Don\u2019t try to bring everything into a single new data platform: you will get bogged down in complexity and leave out key sources of high-quality data. Instead, start with those golden sources that provide deep insight into customer behavior or performance, such as credit card transactions or mobile phone records, and work on creating intuitive interfaces for these operations.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Use microservices<\/b>: Focus new development on decentralization, changing behavior, and building new applications that are tailored to how today\u2019s customers want to interact with their banks. Microservices are a good fit for this aim.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Categorize capabilities<\/b> <b>for customer journeys<\/b>: Banks should identify key customer processes and map out their specific requirements for seamless digital experiences. The first step is identifying which functions are essential at each stage of a journey \u2014 and which are not. It may be tempting to use new technology as an opportunity to provide every possible service; but banking leaders should be aware that they could create distracting complexity if they don\u2019t maintain simplicity at every step.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Prioritize integration<\/b>: Rather than simplifying systems, leading banks use a strategy of integrating with modern tools while keeping legacy core intact. Then, they start slowly moving core processes to their new environment over time.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Rely on SaaS for non-critical capabilities<\/b>: While many enterprises still rely on internal resources for service delivery, SaaS has proven especially effective for streamlining business processes. By moving applications like HR, procurement and other back-office systems (such as accounting) from onsite servers to a cloud platform, IT teams can focus their efforts on upgrading their mission-critical software.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Think globally, act locally<\/b>: Global platforms are good but have their limits. If a bank takes an overly broad approach, it may build barriers for future innovation and harm customer outcomes by forcing them onto one global platform. Instead, focus on creating shared data models and core services that can be extended to support business-critical activities while remaining agile enough to accommodate alternative paths.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>How Hard is It to Modernize My Legacy Banking System?<\/h2>\n<p>Initially, the idea of modernizing legacy systems was too unrealistic for many banks. The only option available was total replacement, which required tremendous effort and heavy investments.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25400 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-papers.jpg\" alt=\"Modernizing legacy systems in banking papers\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-papers.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-papers-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-papers-600x399.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.intellectsoft.net\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/Modernizing-legacy-systems-in-banking-papers-450x300.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But things have changed these days.
