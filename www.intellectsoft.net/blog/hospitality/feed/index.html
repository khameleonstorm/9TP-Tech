We’ll look deeper into the hotel trends, discover the reasons and benefits your business can get from their applying, and learn more about the latest trends in this area in</p>
<h2>Future Hotel Technology Trends: What to Expect?</h2>
<p>Due to the recent changes in modern society &amp; people’s lifestyle, travel, tourism, and hospitality industries cannot but wonder about the hotel service’s future. All the future modifications in hotel technology are mostly based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">customer comfort level increasing</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">service optimization and development</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">workflow automation and improving</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">the Internet of Things applying</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">revenue growing</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">smart marketing and reputation management</li>
</ul>
<p><i>According to the research on </i><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1155082/coronavirus-hotels-level-of-comfort-improvement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>improving the comfortability of hotel stays by Statista</i></a><i>, 35% of respondents want their hotels to arrange contactless payment.</i></p>
<p>This hotel technology trend will increase the comfort for the hotel guests and optimize the check-in and check-out procedures and significantly improve the workflow.</p>
<p>One in four interviewees also expects the smart room keys in their hotels. That’s because being on vacation or business trip in an unfamiliar city, people often tend to lose some items like the room keys, or else forget to lock their door, etc.</p>
<p>However, by providing the smart room technology trend in the hotel industry, you can quickly solve this problem. For example, modern hotels are now recommending downloading the mobile app to get full access to their rooms. Additionally, you will save a significant sum of investments, as you no longer need to order the plastic cards or re-issue the keys.</p>
<p>These examples were demonstrated to show the hotel industry’s real need to keep up with the pace and apply new technologies to enhance their business. Nevertheless, there are many more technology trends in the hotel industry that can be useful for your business, so let’s dive in.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25002 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends.jpg" alt="Hotel Trends" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>The Main Hotel Technology Trends Nowadays</h2>
<p>At present, various hotel owners apply more and more hotel technology ideas to reach the final consumers and encourage them to book the apartment immediately.</p>
<p>Some hotel innovation ideas are common worldwide, while others may depend on the hotel’s location and targets. So, here we will look through the key points of hotel industry technology trends widely applied now.</p>
<h2>Top-Ranking Technology in Hotel Industry in 2022</h2>
<p>Smart energy management, robot delivery, and unified property management systems promise to become the most popular hotel technology trends in 2022. The reasons for this are the general tendency towards sustainability, the consequences of a global pandemic, and the constant search for better personalization tools for guests.</p>
<h3>#1 Smart Energy Management</h3>
<p>The trend towards smarter energy management has become possible with the adoption of sophisticated ML algorithms that can track thermodynamic changes and weather conditions outside and sensors that record energy control. Since the electric power industry as a whole is <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/energy-and-resources/articles/power-and-utilities-industry-outlook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forging a path</a> to a cleaner and more sustainable grid, the hospitality industry won’t lag behind.</p>
<p>From lighting to climate control, smart energy management allows hotels to save on average 20% of energy consumption, which is cost-effective for hotels.</p>
<p>Also, smart energy management is able to cut down on carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 70%. From a guests’ perspective, the hotel technology will help adjust their rooms to their preferences, creating a personalized experience that makes customers happy and more likely to return again.</p>
<h3>#2 Robot Delivering</h3>
<p>The COVID pandemic introduced the need for social distancing, and this norm accelerated the adoption of robots in hotels. Combined with the constant search for opportunities to create unique experiences, the technology will let hotel owners create a safe and fun recreation space. In 2022, the main applications of robots are service delivery and collecting items for customers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24997 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-Resort.jpg" alt="Hotel Trends Resort" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-Resort.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-Resort-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-Resort-600x398.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-Resort-450x299.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>For example, the robotic waiter could be designed to deliver food and drinks to guests, which would free up servers to take orders or perform other tasks while still providing guests with their service.</p>
<p>This means that even if a hotel has dozens of floors and rooms, the owners will no longer need to hire tons of people to deliver food and supplies. Humans can provide more valuable input, like answering questions from guests who interact with these robots and ensuring customer care service takes place.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive new technologies in hotels is robots that complete various tasks traditionally performed by humans. For example, the FlyZoo hotel by Alibaba has used robots to occupy the room service staff, provide the guests with all the necessary information, clean the rooms, and automate the routine processes to the extent possible.</p>
<h3>#3 Unified Property Management Systems</h3>
<p>In 2022, hotel properties are expected to move to a unified <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/hotel-property-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">property management system</a>, a software type that assists in automating daily operations and administrative tasks in a hotel.</p>
<p>Moreover, the unified in-hotel experience means guests will be able to interact with hotels across many different brands using one mobile app.</p>
<p>The hotel technology creates a united network between various in-hotel properties, with all key information collected in one system.</p>
<p>Guests can enjoy the intuitive experience of finding and booking their ideal recreation easily, seeing immediately its location, detailed description, and availability. This way, the booking process should take just a few taps from start to finish.</p>
<h2>Hotel Guest Room Technology Trends</h2>
<p>One of the first things that make the visitors’ first impression is the room they will stay in. That is why hotels are now focusing on improving the customer experience, accommodation, service, and facilities.</p>
<p><b>Here are the top </b><b>hotel technology trends</b><b>, which you can consider for improving the hotel performance. </b></p>
<h3>#4 Mobile Keys</h3>

<p>The hotel technology includes different features like booking a restaurant, paying some extra bills, or reminding about personal preferences to provide the perfect experience for any client.</p>
<h3>#5 Smart Rooms</h3>
<p>Since our world is going digital, many technologies are created to make the routine easier and comfortable. For instance, voice control, facial recognition, and mobile control can put the visitors’ personal experience to the next level and feel them stay here a little longer or come back later.</p>
<p>Just imagine yourself entering your room after the tiring strolling on the streets of the unfamiliar city or the working conference. Along with your command “tired,” the voice assistant will instantly prepare the relaxing bath, offer some TV series to watch, etc. Sound like a great idea for your hotel innovation, isn’t it?</p>

<p>In America, the customer-centric model of business has already transformed from a trend to a necessity. Simultaneously, the hotel founders are still interested in their business optimization to make the most of it.</p>
<p>Here are the leading hotel technology trends in America, which are still on the top in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2021, the hotel industry has to deal with raised concerns about safety and personalization from travelers.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/transportation/summer-travel-plans-survey-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As Deloitte observed</a>, people choose to stay in a hotel this year because they feel more secure there (89% of respondents) and prefer the amplified sense of control over exposure and their own safety (86% of respondents).</p></blockquote>
<p>In the given circumstances, industry players are in constant search for <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/hotel-technology-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting-edge technologies</a> that will provide the desired level of control and safety for their visitors.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24910 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Room-Solution-Remote-Control.jpg" alt="Smart Room Solution Remote Control" width="640" height="479" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Room-Solution-Remote-Control.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Room-Solution-Remote-Control-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Room-Solution-Remote-Control-600x449.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Room-Solution-Remote-Control-450x337.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In this regard, smart rooms are the tools that meet these needs and serve a variety of other purposes, including improving guest experience to increase revenue.</p>
<p>However, many businesses hesitate to implement them due to a lack of knowledge regarding their use cases and challenges. In today’s post, we’ll go over the best smart room technologies and reveal their substantial benefits to let you create a smart room blueprint for your own solution.</p>
<h2>What Is Smart Room and How Does Everything Work?</h2>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/big-organizations-use-smart-solutions-iot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IoT devices</a>, a smart room appears as an app that helps guests find, book, pay, and control their hotel stay on site on their smartphones or through a single smart hub.</p>
<blockquote><p>The popularity and number of features inside smart room solutions are growing, making the app or the smart hub more and more accurately designed to make booking a hotel room easy, secure, and more enjoyable, both for guests and owners.</p></blockquote>
<p>The range of applications of smart rooms is tremendous and goes beyond the ability to search for available hotels in your city or use the wireless connection and USB charges as in-room technology in hotels.</p>
<p>The solution establishes the basis for a hyperpersonalized experience for guests, meaning that each action, device, and facility can be adjusted to their needs at the comfort of owners.</p>
<p>For example, smart room technology can let the guest choose the preferred temperature and entertainment without the need to switch between separate devices. Also, travelers and housekeepers can interact with anti-virus robots that bring them morning coffee and newspapers, along with numerous other use cases.</p>

<p>In this case, IoT-enabled key devices (like lighting, heating, air conditioning systems, blinds, or draperies) will be connected to the hotel’s systems through a central controller, be that a smart hub, speaker, smartphone, or tablet. This way, the smart room lets guests manage multiple devices on their phones. In their turn, owners can get more control over the resources they spend.</p>
<h3>2. Voice Control for Entertainment</h3>
<p>There are various ways to apply voice recognition in smart hotel rooms, starting from managing TV to navigating through pay-to-view entertainment on several devices. In this regard, Amazon Echo and Alexa are the most popular devices with this function in hotels to date.</p>
<h3>3. Smart Hubs</h3>
<p>With smart room technology, guests and owners can improve room service collaboratively. In particular, smart hubs can let your guests order breakfast in bed, book an appointment with an on-site masseuse, and even arrange for a post-workout shower.</p>
<h3>4. Interactive Hotel Maps</h3>
<p>A wall map in a hotel can be enriched with augmented reality to provide more interesting and interactive experiences to clients. Depending on the level of sophistication, this smart room technology can help your guests find their way around and even tell you when their favorite restaurants are open.</p>
<h3>5. UVC Lighting Control for Disinfecting</h3>
<p>Smart rooms in hospitals are highly effective at killing viruses with UVC technology that is safe for humans. Among the in-hotel applications of this smart room technology for healthcare, you can sanitize packages and room keys, thus helping your guests feel safer in your hotel.</p>
<h3>6. Branded Mobile Apps for Hotels</h3>
<p>Letting guests control their hotel experience <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/mobile-app-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an app</a> is one of the best practices for smart rooms. When travelers can find, book, control, and review their stay in one place, you get the source of valuable information to improve your services and apply for marketing activities.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24912 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Room-Solution-Tablet.jpg" alt="Smart Room Solution Tablet" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Room-Solution-Tablet.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Room-Solution-Tablet-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Room-Solution-Tablet-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Room-Solution-Tablet-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>7. Hotel Robots</h3>
<p>You can teach robots to bring towels or tea to the smart room, freeing your maids to do other work and increasing their safety thanks to social distance maintenance. Even more, hotel robots can assist people in more sophisticated tasks, like fixing technical errors, noticing poor connectivity, and notifying housekeepers about food shortages.</p>
<h3>8. Digital Concierges</h3>
<p>This smart room technology is an excellent way to save time on the back end without limiting the guest experience. In hotels, virtual robots and chatbots can handle the most basic inquiries, including answering typical questions about facilities or today’s restaurant menu.</p>
<p>They allow housekeepers to take care of the big things. Also, digital concierges are a great way to help reduce contact with guests without humans having to be there at all.</p>
<h3>9. Contactless Tracing</h3>
<p>The enhanced safety level of smart meeting rooms includes contactless tracing, meaning an ability to handle safe meetings and events in hotels. Such devices track movements and alert about social distancing problems, improving safety measures for crowd control on site.</p>
<h3>10. Contactless Payment</h3>
<p>For extra safety, it’s essential to provide your guests with the ability to pay for services without using a touchpoint. In this regard, supporting mobile wallets and providing an option to book a stay in an app are the must-have smart room technologies for hotels these days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At present, the importance of customer experience has already exceeded the pricing and product quality: people pay way more attention to the client service and support, rather than the product or service itself.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24629 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Receptionist.jpg" alt="Hotel Front Desk Management Software Receptionist" width="640" height="481" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Receptionist.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Receptionist-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Receptionist-600x451.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Receptionist-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

<p>In this article, you’ll find these answers!</p>
<h2>What Is Front Desk Management Software for Hotels?</h2>
<p>A hotel front desk management system is a solution that facilitates managing all the front desk work within a single platform.</p>
<p>Thus, the hotel staff can easily input, quickly update and operatively manage the key processes of the hospitality unit using the unified system. Depending on the features the front desk system includes, this kind of software can <a href="https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume3No3/Paper13-The_Use_of_Information_and_Communication_Technologies(ICT)in_Front_Office_Operations_of_Chain_Hotels_in_Ghana.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cover nearly every front office function</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Apartment reservations</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Room allocation</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Check-in and check-out</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Billing and accounting</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Guest history and critical client information</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The front desk software for hotel is the right solution for optimizing the resources invested for smooth yet <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/hotel-property-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional hotel management</a>, which will not only benefit the hotel business performance but also enhance customer services as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/sg/Documents/public-sector/sg-ps-tech-trends-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deloitte’s recent report</a>, the future-focused businesses are now ready to invest into transforming the product- or service-focused center into a customer-focused driver of value. And that’s no surprise since over 84% of customers are ready to spend more for receiving better customer service (<a href="https://www.gladly.com/blog/great-service-drives-revenue-in-gladlys-customer-expectations-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gladly, 2020</a>).</p>
<h2>Benefits of Front Desk Management Software for Hotels</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the essential features to include in the hotel front desk software, it’s essential to understand what this technology can provide to your business.</p>
<p>In fact, by incorporating the innovative technology solution for the front desk at the hotel, you can significantly increase the business income.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24628 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Lobby.jpg" alt="Hotel Front Desk Management Software Lobby" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Lobby.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Lobby-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Lobby-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Lobby-450x253.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Here are the essential benefits you’ll get using the front desk software for hotel:</p>
<h3>Reduce the Front Desk Workload</h3>
<p>One of the core ideas of the front desk at a hotel is to provide high-quality services for the customers. The front desk staff is responsible for check-ins and check-outs, room management, customer service, and other important hotel staff information updates. The huge workload caused by these and plenty of other factors could directly impact the quality of the customer service.</p>
<p>The front desk software for hotels allows automating the key processes of the hotel management and effectively performing the time- and labor-consuming tasks, thus providing more opportunities for improving the customer service.</p>
<h3>Enhance the Teamwork</h3>
<p>When managing a large hospitality institution, it becomes more challenging to operate the hotel staff, keep them informed about the updates and assign new tasks or duties. With the hotel front desk software solution, all the employees can access their profile, review and prioritize all the tasks, and effectively run their duties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this technology allows creating a single communication system that saves up hours of time needed for arranging the meetings or individually informing the hotel staff on demand: reach any of the hotel workers online!</p>
<h3>Get a Clearer Improvement Strategy</h3>
<p>Another great thing about the front desk software for hotels is the ability to get accurate data regarding the hospitality business performance, define the strong sides and weak points for further hotel service improvement.</p>
<p>The detailed analytics and multiple research tools allow getting the full information regarding the most popular hotel services (restaurant, gym, spa, cleaning or travel guides, breakfast, cleaning, transportation, etc), the most favorable booking dates (holiday seasons, weekends, or celebrations) and more.</p>
<p>It also helps to define the most common client pains and which services should be improved or removed (especially the unprofitable ones), which can certainly improve the overall hotel performance.</p>
<h3>Improve the Guests’ Experience</h3>
<p>Multiple investigations in client service have shown that leveraging hotel front desk software big data can save up to 670 working hours per year! By reducing the workload of the hotel’s front desk (calls and guests requests automation, online reservations, and advanced hotel staff management), your employees have more time and resources for interaction with your clients and providing better services.</p>
<p>At present, clients highly pay attention to the service quality, so it becomes even easier to turn the one-time visitors into loyal guests of your hotel.</p>
<h3>Increase the Business Profitability</h3>
<p>Last but not least, the hotel front desk management system is a perfect software that allows enhancing business profitability by automating key management processes.</p>
<p>You’ll save up on labor and improve the individual KPI of your hotel staff, optimize the key front desk tasks and boost the customer experience, which consequently <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/hotel-revenue-management-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results in higher revenue rates</a>. So, what exact features do you need to look for in the best front desk software for your hotel?</p>
<h2>Main Features to Include in a Front Desk Management Software</h2>
<p>Hotel front desk software is much more than a simple management tool, as it includes all the necessary features needed to automate and optimize the key management processes of any hospitality unit.</p>
<p>Developing this type of management system is one of the best approaches to incorporate the most critical features your business requires for workflow automation and services improvement.</p>
<p>Let’s now uncover the most essential features a hotel unit certainly should include in its front desk management solution.</p>
<h3>Reservation and Booking Management</h3>
<p>The front desk system accumulates all the booking information from different channels and conducts a real-time checking of these channels to ensure the proper reservation tracking.</p>
<p>This software can accurately inform about the total number of apartments booked and ready to move in, calculates the most popular booking dates, and provides a detailed overview of the visitors’ reservation trends.</p>
<p>At the same time, it allows users to process the deposits and check the reservation status in real-time, thus optimizing the workload of the reception desk.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24627 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Guest.jpg" alt="Hotel Front Desk Management Software Guest" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Guest.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Guest-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Guest-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Guest-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Check-in and Check-out Control</h3>
<p>The other feature that reduces the hotel staff workload and enhances hotel management is the automated check-in and check-out system. With this option, the front desk employees can quickly process the customer flow and update the apartment information within a single tool.</p>
<p>Hotel guests can feel the difference in the service speed: their visits will be processed up to 5 times quicker than using the standard system. Additionally, hotel staff can effortlessly track room service, prioritize the tasks, and fulfill all the clients’ requests according to the front desk data input.</p>
<h3>Automated Guest ID Registration</h3>
<p>To guarantee the clients’ privacy yet optimize the registration speed, it’s a great option to allow users to manually upload the ID documents for their quick and safe processing. The guests’ ID, as well as all the other important information, can be <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/big-data-in-hospitality-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stored in the hotel database</a> and retrieved later on-demand (mostly, when it’s needed to process the booking requests from the same client).</p>
<h3>Automated Communication Methods</h3>
<p>In the digital era, nearly all the interaction between the clients and the service vendors comes through online services: chatbots, emails, specific notifications, and more.</p>
<p>It’s much more convenient, faster, and doesn’t require direct communication with the front desk staff. According to several pieces of research, people mostly prefer texting methods of communication, and less use the direct interactions (which is exceptionally important in the post-pandemic times): it’s quicker and more convenient.</p>
<p>By including multiple methods of communication, you can not only enhance the time needed to process the clients’ requests but also reduce the front desk workload as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24630 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Room.jpg" alt="Hotel Front Desk Management Software Room" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Room.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Room-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Room-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Front-Desk-Management-Software-Room-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Hotel Services Management</h3>
<p>If your hospitality unit offers different types of services for the clients’ use, it’s a great idea to include these services management into your front desk at a hotel.</p>
<p>This way, front desk workers can easily update the price and availability information for each service, add the discounts and promo codes, and even analyze the trends of the hotel service use. This data gives additional directories on how to improve the existing hotel features as well as the general guests’ preferences: restaurants, cleaning, sports, and more.</p>
<h3>Room Cleaning and Housekeeping</h3>
<p>It’s also critical to create a single system that every staff member can make use of, especially the housekeepers. By accessing the front desk management system, they can quickly review and update the information regarding the room and its supplies, as well as the room availability status for the next booking.</p>
<h3>Other Great Tools for Front Desk Hotel Software</h3>
<p>To make the most of your front desk at the hotel, it’s also important to include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Tracking calendars &#8211; allows checking the up-to-date reservation information and avoid double bookings</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Reporting tools &#8211; assists in analyzing the occupancy level, <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/a-simple-guide-to-hotel-inventory-management-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotel inventory</a>, and sales to provide the critical insights needed for the profitability improvement</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Notification systems &#8211; the different channels created for both hotel staff and guests enable quick yet effective updating of the room service status, check-in or check-out information, upcoming events that might be useful for guests, and more.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Team management &#8211; allows administrating, assigning, and supervising different tasks and track their status within a single software system.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Guests’ service &#8211; enables automatically informing about the balance and expenses, generate receipts, and sending the critical updates (reservation, housekeeping reports, post-stay emails, and more)</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24395 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Room.jpg" alt="Hotel Property Management Software Room" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Room.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Room-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Room-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Room-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Room-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>And, though the first one is now considered to be a common practice every hotel implements to their development strategies, only few of them invest in <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/contactless-guest-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guest experience</a> improvement.</p>
<blockquote><p>With the right software implemented, the hotel units can greatly automate daily operations and administrative tasks to enhance customer satisfaction, and boost client loyalty as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hotel’s functioning requires the active cooperation of multiple departments, with each step being tracked and verified. Before the computer systems implementation, this was traditionally done manually with tons of paperwork and time-consuming managing tasks.</p>
<p>Now, most of the hotel management workflow in hospitality tends to be optimized. That is why one of the must-have software to utilize is the property management system (PMS).</p>
<h2>What Is Hotel Property Management Software?</h2>
<p>In the hospitality industry, a property management system refers to the software that enhances the hotel’s daily management workflow and specific administrative tasks.</p>
<p>In other words, this system is used for organizing, scheduling, and automating the specific tasks of the hotel management process to simplify the hotel operating system and increase the overall performance.</p>
<blockquote><p>The first hotel PMS systems appeared in the 1970s and have developed into a prospective industry with a market size valued at over <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/property-management-software-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.9 billion USD in 2020</a>. These numbers are also expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% from 2021 to 2028.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is it so important? The basic purpose of hotel PMS is to manage numerous properties within one software, employing the centralized yet automated tracking system that increases business efficiency.</p>
<p>Hotel property management software is exceptionally important for the hospitality industry, which integrates the functioning of different departments and various services to provide a high-quality guest experience.</p>

<h2>Basic Features of the Hotel Property Management System</h2>
<p>Going deeper into the main functions presented in a hotel PMS software, the modern systems feature multiple management options for different departments, including accounting, audit, maintenance, front desk, security, etc. The common features of the PMS system for hotels usually include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Marketing and Sales:</b> client files, guest histories, travel agents, direct mails, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Accounting</b>: balance sheets, accounts payable and accounts receivable profit-and-loss statements, payrolls and others.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>HR Management</b>: personal files, time and attendance, working schedule, etc.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Reservations Management</b>: room availability, online booking, yield management.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Front Desk</b>: cashier, room status, guest accounts, guest credit audit, advance deposits, bonus systems, and so on.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Call Accounting: </b>guest information, phone call posting.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Housekeeping</b>: room status, room service.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Maintenance</b>: work orders.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Restaurant Service</b>: up-to-date menu,<a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/a-simple-guide-to-hotel-inventory-management-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> inventory,</a> recipes, point-of-sale, delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>These options presented are only one of the few basic features that should be included in the hotel property management system, they can be also modified and improved to provide better hotel management performance.</p>
<p>One of the core <a href="https://nscpolteksby.ac.id/ebook/files/Ebook/Hospitality/Hotel%20Front%20Office%20Management%202007/5.%20Chapter%204%20-%20Property%20Management%20Systems.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideas of implementing the hotel PMS</a> software is to create the feature-rich environment needed to assist the clients and deliver better guest service. Without having a unified system, any of the core departments such as housekeeping, front desk or accounting would take much more training and many labor hours.</p>

<h2>Create Your Professional Hotel PMS System with Intellectsoft</h2>
<p>There are two ways of creating the hotel property management software for your business: by manually creating the system with the guidance of your team of developers or hiring a dedicated team of developers to create a professional, feature-rich hotel system that will fully meet all your business needs and requirements.</p>
<p>The first method tends to be more unstable for use, as you cannot be certain about the final product quality and its stable performance. That is why investing in the individual hotel property management system is a great option for the hospitality units to develop the right software they need for providing better customer service.</p>
<p>Instead, the experienced team of developers can:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Provide deep research of your project;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Conduct profound research of the market and its main players;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Analyze the main requirements and functions your business needs;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Include the other technologies that are widely used in your industry;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Present the professional PMS system with all the essential features for performance automation, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why cooperating with a professional team of developers is considered to be the most beneficial option for launching the best hotel property management software for any business.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24393 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Development-.jpg" alt="Hotel Property Management Software Development" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Development-.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Development--300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Development--768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Development--600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Property-Management-Software-Development--450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the COVID-19 pandemic hit, more and more businesses started working on the customer experience and business value improvement.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24280 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Room.jpg" alt="Guest Loyalty App Development Room" width="850" height="595" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Room.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Room-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Room-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Room-600x420.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Room-450x315.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>In the hospitality industry, various brands, companies, and services can see the real results from loyalty program development in only a few months: up to 10% of sales and to 15% of transaction boosting, and around 20% of average spendings lift, according to PwC recent research.</p></blockquote>
<p>The customer loyalty app refers to the most effective and efficient method of enhancing the UX in hospitality.</p>
<p>However, developing a mobile app loyalty program for hotels is not easy: they should contain the basic app features, all the range of services, and high-rated user engagement. In this article, we’ll cover the main things you should be aware of before starting creating a loyalty app project.</p>
<h2>What Is a Customer Loyalty App?</h2>
<p>In the hospitality industry, a customer loyalty program app refers to the software that increases client engagement and makes your guests more motivated to interact with the hotel and its services, consequently resulting in higher conversions and better revenue.</p>
<blockquote><p>Usually, this type of loyalty apps creates incentives through rewarding points, special offers, discounts, and membership cards. For hotels, it can include the restaurant menu, tourism services, range of sports and leisure facilities, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>A customer loyalty mobile app is also a form of marketing strategy, designed to encourage using various hotel services via their smartphone so that you can get in touch with the reception and order any of the services available within a click.</p>
<h2>The Potential of Loyalty Reward Apps</h2>
<p>The importance of the loyalty program development for hotels cannot be underestimated, as it is one of the most effective communication and sales channels for the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>With the customer loyalty apps, it becomes much easier to interact with your customers, understand their needs and preferences, inform them about the latest news and events nearby, and offer the additional services the hotel can easily benefit from.</p>
<p>Additionally, mobile loyalty applications are a great option to increase brand awareness and improve customers’ loyalty as well. Thus, hotel units will get higher conversion rates with fewer investments into advertising because of having more loyal clients!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24282 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Usage.jpg" alt="Guest Loyalty App Development Usage" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Usage.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Usage-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Usage-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Usage-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Guest-Loyalty-App-Development-Usage-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>And the guests can benefit from the loyalty program app as well: they can easily stay in touch with the hotel staff and order any services they need for a comfortable stay. Also, they can enjoy the personalized offers and promotions offered depending on their personal interests, and even in different languages.</p>
<p>The reminders and notifications will help to keep your guests always updated about anything they might need during their journey.</p>
<p>With the mobile app loyalty program, they no longer need to take a plastic card to use the services or open their apartments, complete the check-ins and check-outs — everything can be done in a few taps on their smartphone.</p>
<p>Such a well-planned strategy of loyalty program development can not only improve the client experience but also <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/hotel-revenue-management-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase the overall ROI</a> as well.</p>
<h2>Benefits of a Loyalty Management System for a Hotel</h2>
<p>Before we start analyzing the main features of a loyalty program app for hospitality, it’s critical to understand whether your business needs it. Knowing the core advantages of loyalty apps can help you to estimate the basic features to pay attention to during the loyalty program development.</p>

<p>With a mobile loyalty app, your business will have more loyal clients who come to stay exactly in your hotel. As a result, their preferences and guest behavior analysis can help you to define the right service strategies to develop for the higher UX.</p>
<h3>#2 Increased Bookings</h3>
<p>Having implemented the loyalty program app into your hotel business and provided your guests with a certain reward program, you are more likely to get the undecided travelers over the line.</p>
<p>In this case, a loyalty program development can become an important criterion of why visitors should use your hospitality services instead of your competitors.</p>
<h3>#3 Saving Investments</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/customer-retention-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEMRush has reported</a> that the average American company can lose 23% to 30% of its customers each year due to a lack of customer loyalty. By focusing on your loyal clients and enlarging their number, you’ll spend fewer costs for the marketing and sales efforts.</p>
<p>Additionally, loyal repeat guests can have much better conversion rates than the average one-time visitors, which makes them more valuable for your business as well.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24139 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Guest.jpg" alt="Cybersecurity in Hospitality Guest" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Guest.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Guest-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Guest-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Guest-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Guest-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>For hotel cyber security, it will remain a great challenge in the future: new hacking techniques are adopted day by day, and it’s nearly impossible to predict and confront them all.</p>
<p>The recent research published by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342683038_A_Review_of_Cyber_Security_Issues_in_Hospitality_Industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research Gate</a> shows that the appraised cost of cybercrimes will approximately reach $6 trillion per year on average after 2021.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is why more and more organizations become concerned about their security level: they’re investing in improving their digital safety and boosting their resistance to hacking attacks and data breaches.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hospitality industry is not an exception: hotel security systems are one of the main priorities to develop for providing maximum comfort for the guests and ensure their secure staying as well.</p>
<p>Today we’ll cover what hotel cyber security is, the main issues hotel cyber security counters with, and also the most popular information security tools it employs to enhance the safety of their data and systems.</p>
<h2>The State Of Cybersecurity in Hospitality</h2>
<p>First of all, cybersecurity refers to a specific plan targeted at a company’s data protection. Most hotels are now aware of the possibility of cyber attacks aimed at stealing the clients’ personal data, internal documents, or any other information.</p>
<p>A well-planned strategy of improving the hotel safety and security can, in fact, minimize the risks of being hacked, thus, ensuring the data won’t be used by fraud.</p>
<p>But what information hackers are usually haunting in hospitality? Basically, there are various data they can benefit from, including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">personal data of hotel’s guests</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">bank card information</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">employee data</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">critical business information, etc</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Risk/Our%20Insights/Cybersecurity%20in%20a%20digital%20era/Cybersecurity%20in%20a%20Digital%20Era.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey’s best-suggested practice</a> to improve hotel cyber security is to build a unified, integrated cyber defense that can protect the entire hotel infrastructure.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24140 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Hacker.jpg" alt="Cybersecurity in Hospitality Hacker" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Hacker.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Hacker-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Hacker-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Hacker-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Hacker-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>The most productive way to get started is the cyber attack assumption, after that try to build an accurate and effective strategy of building the system resistance to all the weak points discovered.</p>
<p>The IT experts insist on implementing an integrated defense to improve hotel security, as it can cover the most common security threats and secure the infrastructure as well.</p>
<h2>Tools to Solve Common Cybersecurity Issues in Hospitality</h2>
<p>One of the most essential cybersecurity recommendations for hospitality is employing the best IT technologies to get the organizations secured from a variety of common threats.</p>
<p>These usually include different sorts of viruses, internal attackers aimed at getting the network access, hardware theft, spooﬁng, unauthorized insider access, unauthorized outside attacks, and service attacks as well.</p>
<p>In general, the most effective protection tools and techniques used for safety and security in hospitality industry include the following:</p>
<h3>Intrusion Detection System</h3>
<p>This technology analyses all the events that happened in the internal network or any other system to detect suspicious activities, intrusions, and attacks.</p>
<p>The so-called intrusion refers to the efforts used to target the system’s confidentiality, availability, or integrity, which can result in system errors and data loss.</p>
<p>Intrusion detection systems can inform about the following types of attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Internet attacks (criminal connects to the system from the Internet or the outside networks)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Authorized attacks (users authorized in the system try to find the vulnerabilities to get access to the secured information or those who misuse and abuse the privileges to get the profit).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Physical Hotel Security</h3>
<p>This point refers to keeping all the networking equipment and computer systems updated and secure. In practice, it means not only purchasing the new equipment but also setting up limited access to it for third parties.</p>
<h3>Hotel System Firewalls</h3>
<p>The powerful yet effective combination of soft and hardware equipment can assist in tracking the device traffic of different computer networks, which is a must for hotel cyber security.</p>
<p>A hardware firewall is a device that can be attached directly to the network, while the software firewall consists of the specific program files targeted at improving the hotel Internet security and is installed on devices (computers, phones, tablets, laptops, etc).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24142 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Room.jpg" alt="Cybersecurity in Hospitality Room" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Room.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Room-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Room-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Room-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Room-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<h3>Encryption Procedure</h3>
<p>One of the most popular measures that can prevent data breaches and minimize the entrance of most hacking attacks is encryption. Basically, that’s a process of transforming the information so it becomes impossible to get.</p>
<p>For hotel security, encryption becomes a perfect method of ensuring data confidentiality, which is critical not only for the hotel’s management and service systems but also for the guests and visitors.</p>
<h3>Biometrics</h3>
<p>The technology of biometrics can greatly assist in the authorization procedures, as it benefits the user authentication systems and more. As a rule, the most popular biometrics systems record the physical characteristics of each individual and compare them each time during the authorization processes before providing full access to specific data stored in the system.</p>
<p>The main examples of the physical characteristics used for biometric technologies include voice recognition technologies, fingerprints, face, retina, or iris identifications. By implementing the biometrics form of authorization you can significantly enhance the hotel cyber security and ensure your users and the entire management system are fully protected.</p>
<h3>Vulnerability Detecting Software</h3>
<p>Last but not least software listed in the cybersecurity recommendations for hospitality is the vulnerability scanning software. Basically, that’s a specifically built software targeted at scanning your hotel’s systems and resources (both internal and for public use) and pointing at the possible vulnerabilities you should definitely pay attention to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the vulnerability detecting software, it becomes way easier to track the entire system performance and define which parts of the hotel security enhancement still need to be improved and what are the best practices for resolving these issues.</p>
<h3>Access Limitations</h3>
<p>To improve the hotel Internet security, it’s also essential to set up limited access to the critical or more vulnerable systems and resources.</p>
<p>By implementing the access control, you can significantly improve the authentication and authorization processes to ensure the access to the specific systems and resources will be available for a limited number of people.</p>
<p>Why is it so important? According to the <a href="https://www.varonis.com/2019-data-risk-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varonis Global Data Risk report</a>, over 53% of companies have over 1000 sensitive files open to every employee. For hotel security, it means that after the employee password is known to the criminals, your system can be easily hacked by anyone and anytime.</p>
<h2>Improving Cybersecurity: Protect Customers’ and Company’s Sensitive Data</h2>
<p>According to the recent trends and effective measures to protect hotel safety and security, there are 3 key points of building the integrated cyber security infrastructure. Let’s now cover them in detail.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24141 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Malicious-Attack.jpg" alt="Cybersecurity in Hospitality Malicious Attack" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Malicious-Attack.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Malicious-Attack-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Malicious-Attack-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Malicious-Attack-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Malicious-Attack-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<h3>#1 Find Your Dedicated Team of Developers</h3>
<p>The first step every company should start with is IT recruiting. A well-built<a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/collaboration-with-an-outsourcing-vendor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> team of IT developers</a> can become one of the most effective ways of improving hotel Internet security.</p>
<p>Infrastructure groups need to always track the latest “trends and tendencies” in security, employ the most effective cyber tools and brainstorm some new ways of detecting the system’s weak points and how they can be resolved.</p>
<h3>#2 Always Stay Focused on Security Improvement</h3>
<p>Instead of paying a hard look only at the very first stages of security improvement, it’s critical to understand this process should be tracked permanently. So, it’s useless to make some changes to the hotel security procedures and exclude them from the priority tasks for the future.</p>
<p>However, organizations should create multiple scenarios to simulate the possible variants of cyberattacks for learning and practice. Furthermore, a clear understanding of each member’s responsibilities in crisis situations, as well as the plans of how to act in critical situations with the team members and public, can help to create a powerful strategy of defending the hotel Internet security.</p>
<h3>#3 Use the Effective Security Tools</h3>
<p>The experienced IT experts know that none of the security software, antiviruses, and other tools can ensure your hotel system is 100% secure from cyber attacks. Nevertheless, hospitality units still need to implement the most updated software and hardware for their data security.</p>
<p>In practice, that means dividing the process of improving the hotel cyber security into 3 phases: preparing and protection; defending and detection; responding and recovering. If one of these phases is omitted, your hotel security can become a tidbit for fraud and hackers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24138 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Developer.jpg" alt="Cybersecurity in Hospitality Developer" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Developer.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Developer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Developer-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Developer-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-in-Hospitality-Developer-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>To conclude, it’s almost impossible to predict the possible cyberattacks in hospitality and be 100% sure they won’t happen again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What could be worse than being tired after a long flight with hungry children in a huge queue to check-in at a hotel?</p>
<p>Or let’s imagine an even worst-case scenario, when you have to go up to the room with your suitcases on your own to find out the room key does not work.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-23986 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Development.jpg" alt="Biometric Technology in Hospitality Development" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Development.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Development-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Development-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Development-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Development-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>None of these scenarios would give a nice first impression of your hotel to new visitors. Luckily, there are so many technologies available to enable you to avoid these situations.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the latest <a href="https://www.condorferries.co.uk/hotel-industry-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a>, today there are more than 700,000 hotels and resorts around the world. This industry only keeps growing and developing every year and is worth more than <a href="https://www.condorferries.co.uk/hotel-industry-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$570 billion</a>. According to <a href="https://www.condorferries.co.uk/hotel-industry-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBISWorld</a>, there are now 91,000 hotels in the United States alone, bringing in about $190 billion annually.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the adoption of biometrics like fingerprints, face or iris scanning, or even voice recognition, biometrics have the potential to revolutionize the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>With this, new levels of efficiency and safety can be created. Let’s learn more about future biometrics for hospitality industry in the article!</p>
<h2>What Is Biometric Technology?</h2>
<p>Biometric technologies are solutions that are commonly used to identify a person based on some aspect, namely, a person&#8217;s unique physical or behavioral characteristics.</p>
<p>The basic premise for biometric technologies is that each person can be accurately identified by their intrinsic qualities.</p>
<blockquote><p>Biometric authentication technology is now widely used in corporate and public security systems, home appliances, and various programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Convenience is also one of the driving forces of biometrics since you no longer need to dial passwords or carry different keys with you.</p>
<p>There are two types of biometrics used to recognize a person. The first type is biometrics based on physiological characteristics. The second is behavioral biometrics. Physiological identifiers include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">facial recognition</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">fingerprints</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">finger geometry (the size and position of fingers)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">iris recognition</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">vein recognition</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">retina scanning</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">voice recognition</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">DNA matching</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">digital signatures</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Does the Hospitality Industry Use Biometric Technologies?</h2>
<p>Components of the hospitality industry such as hotels, resorts, and others often face the challenge of ensuring the safety of guests while maintaining all the amenities.</p>
<p>If your hotel has a lot of security measures, guests may not like it and they may never come back. If, on the contrary, security measures are weak, this can lead to theft or something else.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-23987 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Guests.jpg" alt="Biometric Technology in Hospitality Guests" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Guests.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Guests-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Guests-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Guests-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Guests-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>Then what the solution will be here? How does the hospitality industry provide security while maintaining comfort and convenience?</p>
<blockquote><p>The best solution is biometrics, which can take full responsibility in case of any problem. The uses of biometric technologies can make life easier for hospitality businesses such as hotels, as well as improve operational efficiency, safety, and convenience in many ways.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the ways to use biometrics in hotels and other establishments in this domain is to implement registration using fingerprint or face recognition. Biometrics are already actively used in hotels in China.</p>
<p>FlyZoo Hotel in Hangzhou allows <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/contactless-guest-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guests</a> to select the floor and room number through a mobile app. Upon arrival at the hotel, there are several options for local and foreign check-in.</p>
<p>The first is that locals can register by scanning their faces through a mobile app. Another option is for foreigners who can check in by scanning their faces through vending machines located throughout the hotel lobby.</p>
<p>It has never been possible to avoid all the formalities associated with hotel check-in, but using biometrics such as fingerprint or face scanning can speed up the process dramatically.</p>
<p>In the same way, hotel staff control guest access to different parts of the hotel, for example by requiring a finger scan to access the pool.</p>
<p>Another way to use biometrics in hotels is to avoid key cards that allow guests to enter their rooms. Instead, a person just needs to scan their fingerprint, which greatly simplifies the system.</p>
<p>There is no need to keep an inventory of keys, give out new ones to guests if for some reason they have lost their own.</p>
<p>Biometrics is also widely used to pay for various additional <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/mobile-concierge-app-development-for-hotels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotel services</a>. For example, requiring your fingerprint to authorize any additional payments for your hotel stay, such as ordering food or drinks in your room, spa treatments, or purchasing various in-room entertainment, will allow you to quickly and accurately bill upon checkout.</p>
<p>It will also help save guests from unnecessary expenses. A child cannot independently order what he wants, without her mother&#8217;s biometrics.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-23988 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Room.jpg" alt="Biometric Technology in Hospitality Room" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Room.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Room-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Room-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Room-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Room-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<h2>Benefits of Biometric Technology in the Hospitality Industry</h2>
<h3>Access Control System</h3>
<p>Ensuring security in the hotel is one of the most important tasks, especially in terms of increasing threats to the hotel business associated with infringement on the lives or rights of guests.</p>
<p>For each team managing the hotel, one of the main tasks is to ensure the security of confidential areas and restrict guests&#8217; access to storage rooms, warehouses, and other technical areas.</p>
<blockquote><p>Biometrics can easily help with this, which will allow you not to worry about the fact that some visitors can get into one of the technical rooms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Previously, keys and locks were widely used to control the access of staff and guests to the hotel premises. Typically, cleaners, like other hotel workers, had to constantly carry a huge number of keys with them, which could easily get lost.</p>
<p>In addition, it was always necessary to run and close or open rooms in case of a visitor&#8217;s loss of room keys or other problems. With the help of biometric security technology, such problems can be easily avoided, as the fingerprint will become the only key to all areas of the hotel, which greatly facilitates the work of technical staff and saves the hotel from unnecessary problems with visitors.</p>
<p>You can also monitor in real-time the access of staff to restricted areas of the hotel, such as guest rooms, washing rooms, etc. You can track which room a particular hotel employee has entered, thereby roughly understand their location.</p>
<h3>Improving Staff Efficiency</h3>
<p>To continually meet the needs of guests and provide them with an excellent hotel experience, managers must continually hire more and more employees.</p>
<p>But with the increase in the number of employees, it becomes more difficult for hotel management to keep track of the working hours of each employee and manage them effectively.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fortunately, biometric identification technology can help with this. After all, such technologies are aimed not only at improving the safety and convenience of customers but also to facilitate the internal <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/a-simple-guide-to-hotel-inventory-management-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">management of the hotel</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The use of biometric will help you easily monitor staff time, improve employee efficiency and ensure transparency in payroll accounting. Biometrics are also used to track visits by hotel staff, which reduces the likelihood of theft and other unpleasant things by several times.</p>
<h3>Personalized Guest Experience</h3>
<p>According to one <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/201704/oracle-research-reveals-biometrics-will-play-key-role-in-hospitality-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>, 41% of hotel visitors visited the hotel more often and stayed in only one hotel if an employee could recognize them without giving their name. In another <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/201704/oracle-research-reveals-biometrics-will-play-key-role-in-hospitality-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a>, 62% of hotel guests believe that such actions by staff will greatly improve their experience of the hotel.</p>
<p>Using biometric technology can help you easily refer to a visitor by name, as well as obtain information about the visitor and their preferences, without having to ask for any additional information.</p>
<p>For example, a guest arriving at a hotel scans a fingerprint at the front desk, after which the concierge will immediately receive all of his personal information, room, and service preferences, to make his stay at the hotel as pleasant as possible.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The adoption of biometric solutions has grown exponentially in a very short period. This technology began to be used all over the world in various industries. The hospitality industry is no exception.</p>
<p>You no longer need to rely on traditional methods of security, registering guests, granting them access to rooms, and tracking hotel technical staff.</p>
<blockquote><p>All these functions can be replaced by the introduction of biometrics, which will radically facilitate hotel management and create even greater comfort for visitors.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, invoicing visitors for hotel services becomes very easy. Customers can also feel secure if they only enter and exit the hotel using biometric scanning technology.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-23990 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Software.jpg" alt="Biometric Technology in Hospitality Software" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Software.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Software-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Software-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Software-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Biometric-Technology-in-Hospitality-Software-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>Combined with CCTV cameras, biometric technology can be the best weapon against security threats. A huge network of hotels around the world, which are found in different parts of the globe, creates a complex and confusing system that requires centralized resource management and the exchange of data between different departments. This can be easily achieved with biometric solutions.</p>
<p>Not all companies can provide quality <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/travel-hospitality-software-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom software development for travel and hospitality</a> services. That is why you need to be very careful while choosing a vendor that could help you with the implementation of such an idea.</p>
<p>The professionals in Intellectsoft have years of experience in developing innovative solutions based on biometric technologies for the hospitality industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, the hospitality industry is using a wide range of tech services due to the increased safety concerns and the rise of remote activities.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-23680 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Finance.jpg" alt="Revenue Management Software for Hotels Finance" width="850" height="479" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Finance.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Finance-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Finance-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Finance-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Finance-450x254.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/hotel-technology-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our guide on top hotel technologies of 2021</a> shows, improvements like increasing customer comfort, service optimization, workflow automation, and smart marketing are gaining momentum.</p>
<p>That’s how smart rooms, mobile keys, and blockchain solutions appeared and became widespread.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, you need money to install all these up-to-date technologies. In the given circumstances, revenue management systems can assist grand hotels and boutique guesthouses alike in generating more funds.</p></blockquote>
<p>The core value of this technology is the same for hospitality representatives of any size: it will help capture the maximum value your visitors are ready to bring to your hotel. In this overview, we’ll explain how it’s possible and which parameters this software should possess to be truly effective.</p>
<h2>What Are Revenue Management Systems (RMS)?</h2>
<p>The notion of revenue management software refers to the diversified set of strategies aimed at increasing the profitability of your company or organization.</p>
<p>Starting from the American Airlines case, the businesses have recognized the advantages of linking value to the specific conditions and yielding more revenue from the segmented pricing. Basically, RMS realizes this idea in technological terms.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-23681 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Job.jpg" alt="Revenue Management Software for Hotels Job" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Job.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Job-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Job-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Job-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Job-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>The exact appearance of revenue management activities can be different, but all of them refer to finding the perfect place, time, and offering for an accurate service recipient.</p>
<blockquote><p>The application of revenue management software reveals its best once you supplement this strategic move with the advanced plan containing the best profitability boost practices already used in your hotel.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you don’t have this plan, here are the things to consider while making it:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Precise forecasting</b>. Set the budget limitations for the nearest season and in a long-term perspective. This way, you’ll better understand your current situation and the exact revenue the technology should generate to boost your profitability.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Analyze your competitors</b>. Determine the traits and characteristics your key competitors possess. Assume which of them leads to greater profitability than yours.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Define the key audience groups</b>. Try to mastermind what are the main categories of your visitors. Are they sole low-budget tourists and businessmen? Are they couples of different income levels? Or is your facility a hostel that attracts one audience category because of constant price dumping? Collect as many assumptions as possible.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Check your technical weaknesses</b>. To get the maximum of the existing software, determine the vulnerabilities of your existing one first. For this, make sure your website has good performance indicators, there’s an online booking engine, and you can do business with your clients online effectively. If any of these parameters are not elaborated, check our guide on <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/hotel-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotel management software</a> specifics and refer to our tech specialists to get a consultation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why Your Hotel Needs Revenue Management Solutions</h2>
<p>Once you’ve collected the set of your hypotheses and ideas, hotel revenue management systems will provide a concrete set of tools to work with them and optimize your resources smartly.</p>
<p>The technology will divide your visitors into segments and offer to supply what they will surely buy. For example, you can provide an extra night for a discounted price for the visitors who arrive late at night, assuming they are likely to oversleep the checkout time and won&#8217;t mind spending one more night in the city.</p>
<p>What’s important: such an idea will be a data-driven decision.</p>
<p>Also, the software allows tracking typical consumption behavior during the stay. For example, your RMS shows only business-class visitors order dinners, while those who choose standard rooms eat elsewhere (or don’t eat at all).</p>
<p>In this situation, at night, you can leave extra bottles of water or drinks in the cheaper rooms and proactively offer restaurant food to business-class visitors at the time of typical orders.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-23683 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Reception.jpg" alt="Revenue Management Software for Hotels Reception" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Reception.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Reception-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Reception-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Reception-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Revenue-Management-Software-for-Hotels-Reception-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>As a result, you’ll get the maximum revenue for each visitor category in your hotel.</p>
<blockquote><p>In essence, hotel revenue management means providing the maximum value for each individual guest.</p></blockquote>
<p>Resources optimization in revenue management can have various manifestations in your hotel. It’s not only about supplying food and rooms cost-effectively.</p>
<p>When it comes to personnel, you can avoid the idle time problem and inaccurate price setting in the selected days of high and low season. As the sum of all these small advantages, you’ll increase your overall revenue significantly.</p>
<p>With revenue management technology, you’ll stop offering your services blindly. Instead, you will increase the loyalty of your visitors and the accuracy of each resource spent in your hotel.</p>
<h2>6 Key Contributions of the Effective Revenue Management System</h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Better allocation of resources</b>. Revenue management solutions should establish an environment where the perfect match between what you sell and what your guests buy constantly happens. Thanks to the intelligent algorithms that constantly track supply and demand, RMS proposes the most effective solutions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cost optimization</b>. With the better-allocated resources, you don’t overpay on features and amenities your visitors don’t fancy. On the contrary, you’ll increase the sales of the items already liked.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Taking advantage of fluid pricing</b>. Hotel revenue management systems will help you capture maximum from changing rates. By reacting to the demand dynamics automatically, you can increase the price of your services accurately.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>A better understanding of your competitors</b>. With the revenue management software, you’ll get an all-in-one overview of everything happening in your market segment. This way, you’ll get the full picture and will change prices smarter and more accurately.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Easy scaling</b>. Of course, you can rely on your own observations and make decisions on the resource allocation manually. But if you have ambitions to grow and become a big hotel, automation of the key processes is what you’ll need first and foremost.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Informed decisions</b>. One of the main contributions of hotel revenue management systems is collecting loads of essential data about your hotel and guests. With this information at hand, you can become more accurate in your assumptions and decisions and know what your customers really want — even if they don’t articulate their wishes proactively.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Things to Consider before Implementing Hotel Revenue Management Services</h2>
<p>Like any technology, hotel revenue management software requires specific knowledge and proper understanding of what the project aims are from the executives.</p>
<blockquote><p>Revenue management by itself is a complicated area where numerous specialists work and different metrics are adopted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, the technology should be easy-to-use and unite all these distinct parameters in one solution. This way, all the workers in your hotel can work with it and detect the information needed for them to work.</p>
<h3>Checklist to an effective hotel revenue management introduction:</h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Determine where you are today</b>. You need to provide a detailed picture of the current state of your hotel.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Set your ideas and hypotheses</b>. Make assumptions on the profitability boost needed, resources available, and guest categories.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Find a reliable technology vendor</b>. While choosing, check the professionalism and discuss the project in detail prior to paying.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Keep in touch with your vendor</b>. While implementing the software, communicate the progress with your vendor. This is needed to adjust the project on the way.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Pass the training</b>. Due to the software complexity, all the workers who work on your hotel&#8217;s profitability must learn how to use it.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Test your hypotheses and improve them</b>. Don’t expect revenue management software to be a magic button that will increase your profitability in a day. You still need to input the data and do something with the conclusions. Consider technology as the tool that will help you work more accurately and analyze information better and faster.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2020-2021, the Coronavirus pandemic affected the previous freedom of movement and travel patterns, and the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/customer-service-in-hospitality-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospitality</a> and event industries suffered from this change the most.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-23414 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Event-Management-Software-People.jpg" alt="Event Management Software People" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Event-Management-Software-People.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Event-Management-Software-People-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Event-Management-Software-People-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Event-Management-Software-People-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Event-Management-Software-People-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>According to the recent <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/retail-distribution/consumer-behavior-trends-state-of-the-consumer-tracker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deloitte report on consumer behavior trends</a>, only one-third of respondents feel safe attending in-person events, and only half are ready to stay in a hotel.</p>
<p>In the given circumstances, the importance of each guest and conference visitor has become tremendous. The previous “common” tiny mistakes and difficulties turn out to be severe and costly nowadays.</p>
<p>In the new harsh reality, it’s inexcusable to search for a missing phone number, contact an important guest, or not invite the potentially interested client to an event.</p>
<blockquote><p>If before 2021 it was recommended to automate these processes, today it’s already a must. Consider getting digital solutions to attract, work with, and stimulate each client.</p></blockquote>
<p>And our guide will explain the specifics and conceptualize the need for implementing online event management software for your business.</p>
<h2>What Online Event Management Software Can Do</h2>
<p>In essence, event management software is the set of technologies that assist in coping with handling conferences. Usually, its toolkit is wide, ranging from planning the event to maintaining the customer base long after the happening.</p>
<blockquote><p>The main purpose of this software is to automate and optimize the existing processes and client base.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though investing in event management tools may sound like a low-priority task for a business owner these days, the possible improvements can bring you good in a long-term perspective. Among all, the solutions facilitate effective planning, engaging new and existing clients, and establishing solid networking.</p>
<p>The set of enhancements also includes an easier registration process, solid assistance to the sales and support team, and even next-gen content optimization. Check the top 5 improvements in the list below!</p>

<h3>5 Common Spheres of Applying Event Management Solutions</h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Registration</b>. Event management software features enable building all-inclusive registration pages. Your clients can fill them from computers and smartphones, and you will have all the needed information stored in one place.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sales</b>. The functionality of event management software includes tracking sales in real-time, creating effective promotional campaigns, and working with mechanics like “early bird” tickets in one place.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Communication with clients</b>. The remarkable feature of online event management software is working with the segmented client base in a language they understand better. Thanks to automated emails and event planners, your clients will get the information they need on time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Networking</b>. The developers recognize that people attend conferences to make new connections. Thus, event management software features include the enhanced matching techniques to facilitate finding common interests and starting conversations with other conference attendants.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Landing pages</b>. In some cases, event management software can include customizable templates and design elements to build attractive and working web platforms to create a marvelous first impression.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5 Benefits of Event Management Software Implementation</h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Full automation</b>. You no longer need to feel and control data manually. The purpose of a well-developed event management solution is to minimize the human effort on hotel maintenance. This way, you can save time and money on completing more important business tasks.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Next-level engagement</b>. The toolkit of event management solutions includes various mechanics to increase attendee participation.

With more data you have at hand, you can make more accurate decisions and establish a more flexible business approach.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cost-effectiveness</b>. The general purpose of the software for event management is to make routine processes faster and effortless. Thus, even the most expensive technology works better for spending optimization than its absence.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Faster planning and execution</b>. Event management tools collect all the data needed for gathering successful conferences: detailed analytics, various types of social media integration, and top-performing marketing instruments.</li>
</ol>

<h2>3 Key Things to Mastermind for Getting a Really Good Software for Event Management</h2>
<blockquote><p>First and foremost, event management technologies are designed to improve the existing processes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, you need an established system first. Before ordering, think of all the present and potential weaknesses your current event management possesses. After making this preliminary step, proceed to meet these recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Determining your needs clearly</b>. The purposes of applying event management systems software are multiple, and your task is to get the top-matching solution for your particular case. That’s why the best software providers always start by discussing the project details. Together, the client and the executor can negotiate on the custom appearance and the specific toolkit.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Choose your top priority</b>. There are multiple event management software features, and you should determine the thing that concerns you the most. Ask yourself a question, “What should I enhance as soon as possible?”. The answer may refer to task management, processes optimization, or participation encouragement, for example. In turn, your software solution should have an appearance that is corresponding to your top priority.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Find a reliable provider</b>. The major part of a really good coding solution in the area of conference and event management software lies on the development side. That’s why we don’t recommend trying to cut costs here — especially if your project includes sophisticated features or includes mobile app development. The better your software is made, the better results it will bring you, and the longer it will work.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, strategizing on software implementation is the major part of software development.</p>
<p>No surprise here: there’s no need to invest in expensive features of the technology blindly if your business will never use them. In this case, the more you think before buying, the better tool you can get from your software provider.</p>
<h3>10 Advanced Software Features Your Event Management Tool Should Have</h3>
<p>Here is the rating of top-demanded software elements for event management in 2021. Note that this list is not complete: we recommend negotiating with your program provider on the particular features your business needs.</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Smart lists</b>. If you’re interested in getting easy-to-use registration, consider this tool. Basically, smart lists are segmented leads you can use to create a personalized experience for your attendees right after signing in to your event.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Analytics</b>. For more accurate communication with your clients, consider incorporating essential metrics. Ask your developer to add settings for retargeting campaigns, conversion rate analysis, and integration with social media.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Widgets</b>. If you need a quick website fix, request event management programs that have embeddable widgets. With them, you can add registration areas, conversation spaces, and sponsor spots hassle-free.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Social integration</b>. Let your software enable sharing through social media channels so that clients can promote your services among their followers. Don’t underestimate the influence of user-generated content on your business performance!</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Mobile app</b>. Let your attendants access the conference schedule, check information about the participants, and communicate with their colleagues in your app! Later, you can use this tool to gather these people again.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Push notifications</b>. As practice shows, push notifications reveal their best as real-time announcements during the event and reminders about the upcoming events.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Voting mechanics</b>. Gamification and asking users’ opinions work in social media awesomely. Why not use them in your event management software? Enable real-time polling to bring power to your conference attendants. Let them change the schedule and invite a speaker once again, for example.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>On-site check-in</b>. Facilitate the registration process and make it compliant with the new social distancing reality. Online check-in can be your branding instrument and the place for sponsorship spots too.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Email campaigns</b>. Consider connecting the email program to communicate with your client database effectively. Thanks to the personalization techniques, you can enhance this traditional marketing tool with more accurate messages and efficient templates.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Promo codes</b>. Another marketing tool that matches event management technologies perfectly. Sell more tickets and test various psychological techniques in one place.</li>
