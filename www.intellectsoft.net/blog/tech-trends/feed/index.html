										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Python is steadily increasing in popularity and remains the second most common language in the world, with <a href="https://www.future-processing.com/blog/how-many-developers-are-there-in-the-world-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11.3 million software developers</a> using it around the globe.</p>
<p>Aside from computer science, Python language has proven to be effective for plenty of other areas, such as statistics, data analysis, physics, economics, electronics, and even the sociology department offers an introductory programming course for the students.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25465 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Python-Frameworks-Development-Team.jpg" alt="Python Frameworks Development Team" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Python-Frameworks-Development-Team.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Python-Frameworks-Development-Team-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Python-Frameworks-Development-Team-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Python-Frameworks-Development-Team-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Python is one of the fastest-growing and most powerful languages with easy-to-use syntax, dynamic semantics, and hundreds of robust libraries and frameworks, which is extensively used for web development as well as for big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s largest companies such as Amazon, Spotify, Quora, and Google are employing the Python web development framework because they always search for innovative technologies and solutions and want to develop advanced applications suiting many requirements.</p>
<p>According to the latest reports, about <a href="https://dev.to/giftedstan/5-python-frameworks-for-web-development-in-2022-9jl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42% of developers</a> claimed that they are using Python as their primary language. Apparently, there are plenty of Python frameworks and features that make it stand out among other web development languages. Let’s check out the key Python frameworks for web development every software engineer should consider before developing websites.</p>
<h2>What are Python Frameworks for Web Development?</h2>
<p>Python is an excellent language to learn to create programs for both newcomers and experienced developers as it emphasizes code readability and features numerous frameworks that aim to cushion the whole software development project.</p>
<p>Python frameworks automate common application building processes and implementation with the help of the programming language.</p>
<p>To be more specific, Python frameworks provide the foundation to build the program on top of, which significantly contributes to the time-efficiency as engineers don&#8217;t have to start developing from scratch and can focus on the application logic without handling low-level details and dealing with repetitive functions.</p>
<p>By the way, the difference between frameworks and libraries isn&#8217;t always clear. Although both libraries and frameworks are reusable pieces of code, they are not interchangeable: while frameworks offer the architecture of the application, libraries provide the collection of packages that performs a specific set of tasks and operations.</p>
<h2>Why are Python Frameworks Significant for Web Development? What are the Core Advantages of Python Frameworks?</h2>
<p>Even though Python frameworks are not an integral part of building applications, they play a significant role as these frameworks facilitate the development by providing particular functionality and allow software engineers to re-use generic modules, and instead of executing routine processes, developers can concentrate on more specific components.</p>
<p>So when software engineers start building a Python-based app, they usually consider an array of Python frameworks for their project and choose the most appropriate one.</p>
<p>The core advantages of the Python web frameworks that demonstrate their importance for web development are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Top-notch protection</li>
</ul>
<p>Built by experienced software engineers, frameworks take care of safety and, therefore, boast effective protection against a number of attacks and threats and give developers tools to avoid mistakes causing security problems.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A strong community of developers and users</li>
</ul>
<p>An ever-growing community of professionals, who improve the platform on an ongoing basis, can provide an immediate response to any problem that may arise. In addition, communities of users offer detailed documentation and articles to give answers to all questions.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Reducing time and money spent on development</li>
</ul>
<p>With frameworks, you receive the fundamental structure, which allows you to avoid reinventing the wheel, and thus you save both time and costs in creating an application and deployment, and therefore improve the overall efficiency.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the high flexibility, frameworks are used to develop micro functions as well as to support the front-end and back-end development for larger projects.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25466 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Python-Frameworks-Web-Development.jpg" alt="Python Frameworks Web Development" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Python-Frameworks-Web-Development.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Python-Frameworks-Web-Development-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Python-Frameworks-Web-Development-600x398.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Python-Frameworks-Web-Development-450x299.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>Types of Python Frameworks for Web Development</h2>
<p>Typically, Python frameworks are divided into three categories, which are full-stack frameworks, micro-frameworks, and asynchronous frameworks.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s find out the meaning of each type:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Full-stack framework</li>
</ul>
<p>As the name implies, the full-stack type is a framework that provides the tech solutions for two basic parts of development: front-end (also known as the client-side) and back-end (the server-side). This category of frameworks is used for any type of application.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Micro-framework</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike a full-stack framework, a micro-framework is a lightweight type that refers to a minimalistic web application, which lacks most of the functionality you might meet in a full-fledged web application framework, like authentication, authorization, and data abstraction layer.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Asynchronous framework</li>
</ul>
<p>The foundation for Python asynchronous frameworks is the asyncio library that is applied to create concurrent code using the async syntax.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Selecting the right languages, tools and platforms have a huge impact on the software&#8217;s functioning – from the simplicity of its creation to the performance and efficiency it can provide. So, once you’ve decided to launch an app, you’ll probably want to consider building your stack around JavaScript – one of the most popular programming languages that are used for websites and non-browser environments as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25410 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Developer.jpg" alt="Node js Overview Developer" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Developer.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Developer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Developer-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Developer-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>And, for the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/nodejs-vs-golang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backend development</a>, programmers suggest using Node js – a cross-platform and open-source environment. In fact, this technology has become extremely popular over the last few years and, thanks to its characteristics, will continue to stand the competition in 2022 for many startups and enterprises.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll make a detailed overview of what is Node.js, its pros, and cons, yet explain the major features that will surely come in handy for you and your business.</p>
<h2>What Is Node.js &amp; How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment and library for Chrome’s Javascript, that is usually applied for developing and running scalable web applications outside the client’s browser. Node.js environment is built on top of Google Chrome’s JavaScript Engine V8, which uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model – lightweight, more productive, and an ideal option for data-intensive real-time apps running across shared devices.</p>
<p>In other words, that’s not either a framework, programming language, or library, which is used for the traditional application software, Node.js is an environment for them.</p>
<p>Today, this environment is popular not only because of the right time and right place; it happened to be <a href="https://nodejs.dev/learn/a-brief-history-of-nodejs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built in 2009</a> by Ryan Dahl. Instead, designed with real-time push-based architectures in mind, it features a large scope of innovative approaches for JavaScript server-side development.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Node.js is already been widely used for front-end and back-end API services development, encompassing:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Traditional web sites</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Chatbot apps</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Single-page applications (SPA) development</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Data streaming</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">IoT app development</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Social media networking (back-end development)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Specific Features of Node.js to Know</h2>
<p>Once you’ve reviewed the basic information about Node.js, it’s time to learn more about its potential – by reviewing the main features of this environment. This will help you to get a better idea of using Node.js, yet helps to evaluate whether or not it’s the right option you need for the software development projects.</p>
<p>Some of the useful functions of Node.js you should certainly pay attention to include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Microservices</b> – an individual, self-contained unit that works alongside others to make up a large application. They allow different app components to be compartmentalized and managed individually, modified, and updated without impacting the application performance.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Event-driven programming</b> – a feature that allows getting a quick response to various forms of user engagement, including clicks or key presses. This feature is designed to detect actions once they occur to reach a more reactive and intuitive UX, and add more to the app flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are 3 major features of Node.js, which helped it to gain that much popularity, and which we should certainly review in detail: Non-blocking I/O, Libuv, and Node Package Manager.</p>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-25411 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Process.jpg" alt="Node js Overview Process" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Process-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Process-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Process-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h3>
<h3>Non-blocking I/O</h3>
<p>This feature is developed to avoid the issue of the synchronous thread (also known as the separate threads) – the situation in which a separate thread is started for each request and blocks the entire process.</p>
<p>Commonly, many environments help web servers to start individual threads, but Node.js allows working with single threads in turns.</p>
<h3>Libuv</h3>
<p>Libuv is the specific cross-platform C library that is mainly designed for Node.js environments and ensures the constant processing of the single threads with the mechanism known as an event loop.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the library creates a pool with up to 4 threads to be processed at the same time. In addition, it automatically sends the requests to the operating system, which significantly improves the timing. This Node.js processing model is mostly utilized on JavaScript event-based models along with the callback mechanism.</p>
<h3>Node Package Manager (NPM)</h3>
<p>Also called NPM, note package manager is in-built support for package management, that includes hundreds of thousands of downloadable libraries for any specific preferences and needs. NPM is mainly known as the world’s largest software registry, which is absolutely free for use and is getting larger day by day, which greatly empowers the Node.js community.</p>
<p>Some of the most useful NPM modules today include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">NPM: Express.js</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">NPM: Meteor.js</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">NPM: Koa.js</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">NPM:Nest.js</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">NPM:Mongo.js</li>
</ul>
<p>With these modules applied, you can more than surely create a powerful module that features a high performance, automates time-consuming tasks, ensures robust routing, and provides top-notch test coverage.</p>
<h2>What Are the Advantages of Node.js Use?</h2>
<p>Another essential aspect we should shed light on in the comprehensive guide to Node.js is the upsides and drawbacks of this environment. In this case, you’ll be more than surprised by the lucrative benefits of using Node js.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25414 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-Node.js-1024x593.png" alt="Advantages of Node.js" width="1024" height="593" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-Node.js-1024x593.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-Node.js-300x174.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-Node.js-768x445.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-Node.js-600x347.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-Node.js-450x260.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-Node.js-1000x579.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-Node.js.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3>Easily Scalable</h3>
<p>First of all, the apps based on Node.js are easily scalable, both vertically and horizontal. Vertical scaling enables adding more resources to the current nodes, while horizontal – allows adding new nodes quicker, which can greatly speed up the development process. Additionally, the Node.js apps can perfectly work with a set of microservices and modules, which makes the development process more simple and easy – a perfect option for scalable startups.</p>
<h3>Large Node.js Community Support</h3>
<p>Along with the millions of fans contributing to support developers across the globe, the Node.js Foundation, which was established in 2015, consists of leading enterprises such as IBM, Microsoft, Fidelity, and SAP. This means you’ll always find support among semi-minders, as well as develop and maintain any framework created.</p>
<h3>First-Class Performance</h3>
<p>Among many developers, Node.js is known as the powerful, feature-rich environment for developing ultra-fast-performing and scalable apps. With the event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O tasks that can easily run on a single thread, without blocking any operations and with almost no delays. These characteristics make Node.js a resource-efficient tool that can greatly accelerate the framework speed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <a href="https://v8.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V8 JS engine</a> complies with Javascript code directly into the machine code, which is mostly used in Chrome and Node.js. Also, Google – the company that developed the V8 engine in 2008, continues investing heavily to improve its performance.</p>
<h3>Advanced Development Speed</h3>
<p>What is more, one of the best features of Node.js use is its ability to accelerate the web app development process with a variety of tools that are lightweight and easy to use. The NPM registry provides a wide range of solutions, modules, and libraries that enable the creation of more valuable apps at a lesser effort and cost. What is more, this environment helps to significantly reduce the bugs, decrease the app size and develop the app in short time frames with the reusable template.</p>
<h3>More Flexible for the Various Software Development</h3>
<p>For most developers, Node.js is a perfect environment for developing cross-platform apps. With frameworks like Electron, NW.js, you can now launch top-notch applications that are fully compatible with nearly any device on macOS, Windows, or Linux.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Node.js supports the MQTT protocol, commonly used by IoT applications, making it easy to connect to independent and third-party services, as well as prepare them for the back-end integration through different environments.</p>
<h3>Contribution to Fullstack JavaScript</h3>
<p>Last but not least, Node.js is a part of a robust tech stack that has proven its potential because of JavaScript – the leading programming language across the globe. As a stand-alone, it provides many benefits to the tech stack such as, for instance, the JSON module library.</p>
<h2>When It’s Better to Avoid Node.js?</h2>
<p>Nearly any technology today has its pros and cons, so before you start using any of those, you should ensure it’ll work best for your project. With all its benefits incorporated, there are still some cases when Node.js is not the best option to choose for the software development process.</p>
<p>You might encounter the other tech solutions in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Creating a perfect software solution</b>. Despite the NPM modules and libraries included, the apps created with Node.js can still have bugs and poor quality in cases when the developers don’t have enough experience with using this system.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>For CPU-intensive computations</b>. It’s better to avoid using Node js if the app server deals with heavy computations, it gets blocked because of the single-threaded quality of Node.js.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Launching a server-side web app with a relational database</b>. If a server-side web app has any CPU-intensive computation, it is likely to block <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/we-improved-node-js-server-response-time-by-100-times/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Node.js responsiveness</a>. Because the Relational Database is still underdeveloped, it’s better to consider the other environments to perform related functions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Heavy server-side processing</b>. Due to its event-driven and non-blocking I/O node models, Node.js can block the incoming requests while the threads are working on computing processes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Successful Examples of Implementation &amp; Future of Node.js</h2>
<p>To evaluate the future potential of Node.js, nothing works better than uncovering the successful use cases of this environment and the ways of its possible implementation in different industries. In the case of the Node.js environment, plenty of companies from various industries have already switched to this technology, for instance, Amazon, eBay, Netflix, Reddit, AliExpress, Paypal, and many more.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25408 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Coding.jpg" alt="Node js Overview Coding" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Coding.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Coding-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Coding-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Node-js-Overview-Coding-450x301.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>So, to define how to use Node.js effectively, let’s review some of these cases more closely:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Because most users interacted with the network through mobile devices, in 2016 <b>LinkedIn</b> decided to switch to Node.js. As a result, the company has boosted its performance by nearly 20x times, empowered servers and reduced their amount from 30 to 3, and drawn its focus on app development and improvement instead of troubleshooting.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Being one of the first companies that started using the Node.js environment in the full production stage, <b>Uber</b> managed to reach a productive, scalable, bug-free app that works perfectly on macOS and Android devices. This tech solution helped them not only to process billions of requests every day but also to match multiple riders to drivers in fractions of seconds.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">After implementing Node.js, <b>Netflix</b> has finally found a scalable solution that can process multiple requests of their users simultaneously. At the same time, they managed to use the same language for front-end and back-end processes, thus significantly saving up the startup time from 40 minutes to less than 60 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, with more than 50% of the developers using Node js in their projects over the last few years, we can make a conclusion that this tech environment will only continue to rise in 2022.</p>

However, the potential of blockchain isn&#8217;t limited to cryptocurrencies, and this financial technology could provide fertile ground for future fintech developments offering new ways of handling information.</p>
<h3><b>5. Virtual Cards </b></h3>
<p>As cybersecurity attacks are on the rise, it has become necessary to develop a new way to protect account data when making online payments. That&#8217;s how virtual 16-digit cards, which are usually valid for a short period, emerged as an alternative payment method that aims to help users protect their sensitive information.</p>
<p>Virtual cards are safe, sustainable, and expire as soon as you complete the transaction. Besides, they might be used as a backup payment method if a standard card gets declined or lost. The rapid advancement in financial technology led to the increased use of virtual cards for businesses as they are easy to receive and use.</p>
<blockquote><p>The total value of virtual card transactions is forecast to reach <strong><a href="https://visa-business-solutions.foleon.com/vbs/knowledge-hub/as-b2b-payments-go-digital-virtual-cards-are-virtually-unmatched/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6.8 trillion by 2026</a>.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3><b>6. Cloud Computing</b></h3>
<p>In the world significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, even the most traditional organizations have to find ways to interact with their customers digitally.</p>
<p>More importantly, they need to build a system allowing them to access, manage, analyze, and control massive data storage in a reality where managers and analysts cannot physically reach their offices.</p>
<p>As Americans were forced to live under official social distancing guidelines, a vital need to move organizations to the cloud as quickly as possible emerged. Leaders should undertake a few essential steps to achieve a smooth transition:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Providing sufficient funding to ensure the employment of all the required technology</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Integrating the cloud to the business model to reflect its widespread and long-lasting impact</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Attracting well-qualified engineers and IT-specialists to support the technology’s everyday performance effectively and to avoid any disruptions</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>7. DeFi</b></h3>
<p>The cryptocurrencies occupied headlines quite often in the previous year, as their underlying technology holds tremendous potential. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1263220/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd-by-segment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent reports</a>, crypto borrowing was the largest single segment of DeFi in 2021.</p>
<p>Blockchain opens up a series of opportunities for protecting any kind of data, not just financial transactions. For instance, payment reconciliation, identity protection, and data access are significantly benefited through the use of this technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being one of the vitally important industries, healthcare has already become the top revenue earner for multiple leading countries across the globe.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the United States alone, the estimated industry revenue for 2021 has reached almost<strong> $2,710 billion,</strong> <a href="https://www.statista.com/study/15826/health-care-and-social-assistance-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Statista</a>, and these numbers will only increase in the upcoming years with the wider use of technology-enabled solutions such as medical chatbots, AI, robotics, IoT and of course, machine learning algorithms – the last one has made a huge contribution into the “smart” healthcare development.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25338 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/estimated-industry-revenue-1024x713.png" alt="estimated industry revenue" width="1024" height="713" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/estimated-industry-revenue-1024x713.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/estimated-industry-revenue-300x209.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/estimated-industry-revenue-768x534.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/estimated-industry-revenue-1536x1069.png 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/estimated-industry-revenue-2048x1425.png 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/estimated-industry-revenue-600x418.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/estimated-industry-revenue-450x313.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/estimated-industry-revenue-1000x696.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In this article, we’ll demonstrate the major machine learning use cases in healthcare, as well as introduce the benefits of its implementation and the future trends of ML technology development for the healthcare industry.</p>
<p>As a part of our discussion, you’ll be able to learn the central challenges of machine learning and, finally, uncover how to successfully develop the software solution exactly for your business goals and needs.</p>
<h2>Major Benefits of Machine Learning in Healthcare</h2>
<p>At present, implementing various innovative technological solutions in the healthcare industry has already become a common practice.</p>
<p>We can now use machine learning algorithms for new drug discovery and advanced research, provide an effective, highly personalized treatment, achieve better imaging and diagnostics, detect and prevent diseases in the early stages, improve patient engagement, and many more.</p>
<p>And those are no longer the future but already a fact: Google has rolled out the ML algorithm that identifies cancer in mammograms, while Stanford University scientists use deep learning to detect various forms of skin cancer.</p>
<p>These are only a few of thousands of brilliant examples of machine learning in healthcare. With this said, let’s now analyze the narrow scopes of successful ML usage: from the disease diagnosis and treatment to its prediction and prevention.</p>
<h3>Diagnosis and Disease Detection</h3>
<p>The most effective area of use of machine learning in healthcare is disease identification and accurate diagnosis. The thing is that some specific diseases, such as different types of cancer or genetic diseases are very hard to detect, especially in their initial stages.</p>
<p>The machine learning algorithms, however, can identify those based on the information and other specific characteristics known, yet provide detailed recommendations of the possible treatment strategy in clinical conditions.</p>
<h3>EHR Storage and Management</h3>
<p>Along with the advanced machine learning technologies implemented, there is still a significant problem with effectively keeping the patient health records, as it requires a lot of time and effort to fill in all the records and track the changes. However, these processes can be optimized with the use of vector machines and ML-based OCR recognition techniques.</p>
<p>For instance, the Medical Vision from Google helps to access the relevant disease information based on the image analysis, which works perfectly for various skin diseases. Or else, with the machine learning algorithms from MathWorks, it becomes much easier to <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/digital-transformation-in-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digitalize</a> handwritten medical records with specific recognition technology.</p>
<h3>Diabetes Prediction</h3>
<blockquote><p>According to the <a href="https://idf.org/aboutdiabetes/what-is-diabetes/facts-figures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest data from International Diabetes Federation</a>, the total number of people aged 20-79 years living with diabetes is approximately <strong>537 million as of 2021</strong>, and this number is projected to rise to <strong>643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045 – in overall, that’s a 45% increase</strong>!</p></blockquote>
<p>However, knowing that diabetes mostly damages the kidneys, the heart, and nerves, it’s possible not only to diagnose this dangerous disease but predict and prevent its occurrence.</p>
<p>As an example, outstanding classification technologies like the Naive Bayes Algorithm, Decision Tree, and SVM employ a set of various machine learning algorithms for detecting diabetes resulting in a positive or negative prediction.</p>
<h3>Liver Disease Analysis and Prediction</h3>
<p>Another important aspect of using machine learning algorithms in healthcare refers to the early prognosis of various liver diseases. Being one of the most essential organs for metabolism, the liver is also highly vulnerable to serious illnesses like chronic hepatitis, liver cancer, cirrhosis, and many more – all these diseases are extremely hard to predict.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after the implementation of machine learning in healthcare industry, this process has undergone a significant shift: now the ML classification and clustering algorithms can effectively predict liver disease using enormous amounts of medical data.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25331 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Machine-Learning-in-Healthcare.jpg" alt="Machine Learning in Healthcare" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Machine-Learning-in-Healthcare.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Machine-Learning-in-Healthcare-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Machine-Learning-in-Healthcare-600x399.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Machine-Learning-in-Healthcare-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Advanced Treatment Personalization &amp; Behavioral Adjustments</h3>
<p>The most prominent machine learning use cases in healthcare refer to building up a more effective treatment plan based on the EHI records for each patient individually.</p>
<p>So, the patient receives a personalized treatment strategy based on his specific health characteristics, gets recommendations about the most effective drugs and accompanying procedures that can enhance the recovery process, and finishes the treatment in shorter time frames.</p>
<p>Additionally, machine learning algorithms are now widely used to change the common behavioral routines and unconscious activities of any person, which can be dangerous from the long-term perspective and result in serious diseases such as, for example, cancer or diabetes.</p>
<h3>Dealing With COVID-19 Infections</h3>
<p>The last but not less important scope of using machine learning in healthcare is its employment for learning and fighting COVID-19. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33842685/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to PubMed</a>, scientists and researchers are now developing ML technology for 2 major applications:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Diagnosing the COVID-19 disease;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Predicting the mortality and severity of this infection based on the detailed analysis of the patients&#8217; age, LDH, CRP, Oxygen Saturation, Lymphocyte, Comorbidities, and many other factors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The core datasets for the machine learning implementation consist of the most reliable yet accurate data: clinical and laboratory records. As a result, this ML tech solution is aimed to enhance the worldwide efforts to control and manage the virus, and hopefully can help to curb it completely.</p>
<h2>What’s the Future of Using Machine Learning in Healthcare?</h2>
<p>Human life is the most valuable thing to care about, so advanced technologies like machine learning without a shadow of a doubt will only gain popularity in the future.</p>
<p>The powerful ML algorithms have already learned how to track and analyze health information and various patient indicators, deliver tons of helpful data for doctors, assist in composing an effective treatment plan and the best care as the outcome.</p>
<p>Moreover, the market size of healthcare artificial intelligence solutions during the period <strong>2020-2026 will grow at a CAGR of over 46.21%</strong> and is estimated to reach revenues <strong>of $44.5 billion by 2026, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-12-01/healthcare-artificial-intelligence-ai-market-size-to-reach-revenues-of-usd-44-5-billion-by-2026-arizton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Bloomberg</a></strong>. Such a tremendous demand for AI solutions means there has never been a better time to enter the healthcare technology market and get on top of the competition within a specific niche.</p>

<p>For serious diseases like cancer treatment, where thousands of new researches are published every day, such a machine can become one of the most critical game-changers: it can scan all the latest resources and help cancer specialists to answer specific questions.</p>
<p>Though these machine learning algorithms in healthcare are still in the early stages of their development, it is expected that Project Hanover can be similarly utilized for the other medical fields that work with big data.</p>
<h2>The Biggest Challenges of Machine Learning in the Medical Industry</h2>
<p>Once you’ve learned the main benefits of machine learning in healthcare, it’s time to consider the challenges you and your team may face when working on the ML project for your business.</p>
<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>Overall, the medical records still represent the patient information, which is personal and forbidden for access. Moreover, some laws and regulations in healthcare, such as HIPAA or GDPR, require EHI encryption to ensure the data won’t be accessed by third parties.</p>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-25328 size-full" style="font-size: 16px;" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Machine-Learning-in-Healthcare-Doctor.jpg" alt="Machine Learning in Healthcare Doctor" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Machine-Learning-in-Healthcare-Doctor.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Machine-Learning-in-Healthcare-Doctor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Machine-Learning-in-Healthcare-Doctor-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Machine-Learning-in-Healthcare-Doctor-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h3>
<h3>Algorithms Transparency</h3>
<p>Transparent algorithms are not solely required to meet all the drug development regulations. Apart from that, it should also provide a clear understanding of the analysis conducted by machine learning algorithms.</p>
<h3>EHR Optimization</h3>
<p>According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), nearly <strong>93% of hospitals</strong> have already implemented the EHR into their workflow in the US, but worldwide statistics are still far from ideal.</p>
<p>For instance, in the developing countries that are developing, these practices are still in the early stages of implementation, which makes the ML technologies helpless. That is why focusing on the EHR system is simply a necessity.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Data Analysis</h3>
<p>Machine learning technology is in the early stages of growth too. So, even if implemented properly, it still lacks value from the long-term perspective, as the specific health indicators and patient diseases tracked today using machine learning in healthcare can barely reach 5 years of time.</p>
<p>Of course, with the algorithm&#8217;s updates and improvements, this situation will change for the better, but at present, the data used by ML is still not enough for a deeper analysis and use.</p>
<h3>Lack of Expertise</h3>
<p>Finally, not all developers possess enough expertise to create and implement the perfect ML solution, and even fewer of them can adapt it specifically for ​​the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>To sum up, machine learning refers to the most significant yet popular technologies that are widely incorporated into the various <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/healthcare-it-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare IT solutions and software services</a>.

<p>Scheduling and keeping track of patient appointments can be an overwhelming task for healthcare professionals. Luckily, appointment scheduling software can help you manage the process from start to finish with the click of a button. Learn more about this healthcare appointment scheduling software in our guide!</p>
<h2>What’s Patient Appointment Scheduling Software</h2>
<p>Appointment scheduling software for doctors and patients automates the process of booking and keeping track of appointments to make sure healthcare providers have more time to devote to their actual work in your medical office.</p>
<p>With efficient scheduling software at your fingertips, you can be sure that patients will never miss an appointment, no doctor’s note will ever be lost, and every minute of your day will be well-spent caring for patients and running your practice, rather than flipping through papers trying to figure out where everyone should be on what day.</p>
<p>Medical appointment scheduling systems are used in healthcare settings to manage patients’ schedules and alert them about upcoming appointments.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/patient-scheduling-software-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many of these systems</a> integrate with electronic health records (EHRs) or practice management software to give clinicians a streamlined process for recording patient information, billing, and generating reports. These systems may include features such as text message or email reminders, room assignment tools, and appointment approval workflows.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25254 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling-Software-Visit.jpg" alt="Healthcare Appointment Scheduling Software Visit" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling-Software-Visit.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling-Software-Visit-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling-Software-Visit-600x399.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling-Software-Visit-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>5 Reasons Hospitals Should Invest in Clinic Appointment Scheduling Software</h2>
<p>Many healthcare practices rely on scheduling software to manage appointments and keep their day-to-day operations running smoothly. These software platforms are often designed to be accessible from different devices, so they can be used at any time, even in the most remote locations where Internet access may not be available.</p>
<p>The list of actual benefits of appointment scheduling software includes</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Better hospital management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Improved patient experience</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Changes become available in real-time and anywhere</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Time and cost savings</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Reduced number of no-shows</li>
</ol>
<p>Appointment booking software is a valuable tool for any healthcare facility, and it’s important to find one that can accommodate all of your business needs. Also,it should be adaptable, intuitive, and convenient for doctors and patients to reveal its best. Otherwise, the IT solution won’t reveal all the advantages we explain below.</p>
<h3>Workload Management</h3>
<p>Software for scheduling appointments makes the difference in helping manage your schedule and client load effectively. At first glance, this seems like an easy task that can be done manually. But the more patients your clinic attracts, the harder it is to keep track of all of them.</p>
<p>In this situation, salon appointment scheduling software provides the needed level of centralization in your booking system. The system adjusts to the needs of your hospital, given that each healthcare provider has its own policy regarding appointment times, dates, and same-day appointments.</p>
<p>Even more, you’ll have easy and quick access to demographic information, medical records, and treatment progress, making it easy to proceed and provide updates to other departments.</p>
<h3>Better Service</h3>
<p>Healthcare providers know how important it is to keep their patients’ appointment schedules running smoothly so that everyone can be seen in a timely manner and overall satisfaction rates are as high as possible.</p>
<p>To accomplish this goal, many healthcare facilities have turned to appointment scheduling software to take the stress and guesswork out of managing appointments.</p>
<p>Not only does this software help schedule appointments quickly and efficiently, but it also allows for more efficient communication between office staff and patients, which can lead to happier patients who get the care they need in the timescale they need it most.</p>
<h3>Faster Delivery</h3>
<p>Appointment booking software is faster and easier to use than existing options, which means a more streamlined and efficient scheduling process. In hospitals that have already implemented the solution, medical professionals log appointment times that fit into their schedules so that patients can easily see their doctors’ availability.</p>
<p>If something changes, mobile notifications will instantly spread the word about an update. In this situation, all users benefit from real-time alerts and stay informed.</p>
<p>With an application that’s easy to navigate, both patients and healthcare providers can focus on what matters most: good health.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25255 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling-Software.jpg" alt="Healthcare Appointment Scheduling Software" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling-Software.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling-Software-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling-Software-600x399.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Healthcare-Appointment-Scheduling-Software-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Cost-Effectiveness</h3>
<p>Customized appointment-related scheduling software can help cut costs, streamline operations, and ensure that you provide quality customer service. Allowing patients to manage their bookings remotely eliminates frustration while improving your office’s productivity — and boosting overall revenues.</p>
<p>Besides, hospitals save time by implementing a centralized patient management system that automates common tasks such as emailing confirmations and reminders to cancel, reschedule or move an appointment. This leaves doctors free to focus on what they do best: caring for their patients.</p>
<p>Finally, appointment scheduling software typically integrates with other <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/electronic-medical-records-software-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronic medical records solutions</a>, so you have access to patient data without having to switch between multiple systems. As a result, you’ll save time and staff resources in order to provide better service while also improving revenue streams.</p>
<h3>Fewer No-Shows</h3>
<p>Today’s healthcare facilities use software for scheduling appointments to avoid no-shows. Generally, patients face difficulty keeping track of when to book a checkup or even knowing how long they need to wait for in-between visits or tests.</p>
<p>This can leave them frustrated and missing out on valuable care. Not only that, but it also places a strain on hospital resources by forcing employees to spend more time scheduling instead of seeing actual patients.</p>
<p>By automating your facility’s patient schedules (as well as extending same-day call times), you’ll be able to cut down on missed visits and allow employees more time for hands-on caregiving.</p>
<h2>5 Core Features Appointment Scheduling Software Should Contain</h2>
<h3>Automated System and Dashboard</h3>
<p>Serving as a bridge between patients and providers, the software should let them cooperate in the most effective manner. In this regard, the automotive appointment scheduling software will solve most of the conflict by showing both sides available time spots only.</p>
<p>Moreover, an intuitive interface is a must for effective appointment scheduling software. Neither patients nor doctors will use programs that are hard to understand and work with. Thus, it’s critical to dedicate proper attention to the design and development of your medical appointment scheduling software.</p>
<h3>Patient Portal</h3>
<p>It’s a good idea to introduce a “self-service” feature in your software where patients can use the calendar and get access to the schedule of doctors in your hospital to schedule their appointments independently. On the same webpage, you can create a patient profile space where a person can review the history of appointments, receive prescriptions, and get lab results.</p>
<p>Simply put, this feature will let patient appointment scheduling software become the main channel of communication with any client, including those planning to visit and those already visiting your clinic.</p>
<h3>Appointment Tracking</h3>
<p>After the global lockdown, the demand for and the number of tools for <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/top-telemedicine-software-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telemedicine</a> has increased exponentially. When it comes to appointment booking software functionality, these instruments help to keep the record of patients’ visits so that a healthcare provider can treat them better.</p>
<p>For example, double-checking the record of a patient’s visit may help notice a new symptom or behavior that will help to adjust the diagnosis and improve the treatment plan.</p>

<h3>Reminders</h3>
<p>This feature lets your hospital deliver better service to patients. Through reminders, you can send all the important information about their treatment, including the day and time of their next visit or the need to take pills. For your clinic, appointment scheduling software reduces the rate of no-shows.</p>
<h3>Mobile-Friendly Version</h3>
<p>Scheduling is the thing mostly done on the go, so the chances people will use your appointment scheduling software frequently will increase if they have mobile access to it. Besides, it’s more convenient to receive updates through mobile notifications.</p>
<p>All in all, mobile applications make work life easier for healthcare providers and patients. They facilitate the task of setting an appointment and actually getting to a doctors’ office for a checkup.</p>
<h2>How to Choose Appointment Scheduling Software Right?</h2>
<p>We recommend picking an IT professional and choosing a medical software that provides all of your healthcare practice’s specific needs in one solution.</p>
<p>For example, you can get dental appointment scheduling software that schedules appointments, automates operations, and improves patient satisfaction. It’s always better to customize a software platform so it meets your unique needs.</p>
<p>In this regard, <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/cloud-computing-in-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many healthcare organizations choose cloud-based solutions</a> because they’re simple and scalable. Cloud-based appointment scheduling software is easy to install with minimal IT resources required for configuration or ongoing maintenance; most providers offer web-based applications accessible from any Internet-connected computer or mobile device.</p>

Thus, we can obviously summarize that the end-users of the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-to-introduce-construction-erp-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">construction software</a> will be architects, builders, remodelers, and designers.</p>
<h2>Top 5 Emerging Trends in Construction Technology</h2>
<p>After we’ve analyzed the state of the construction industry, its forecasted development scenario, and the major areas of its further growth, it’s time to uncover the major trends in construction technology the companies should focus on today.</p>
<h3>Construction Project Management Software</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/construction-project-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project management software</a> for the construction industry is one of the vital tools that benefit the most profitable resource allocation, help to build a strong business strategy and, of course, keep the competitive positions on the market. The professional software solutions can tackle all the critical yet time-consuming tasks and processes</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Easily deal with requests for information documents (RFIs)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Perform data compiling, analysis, and sharing</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Storage the project documentation</li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Run budgeting processes</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Conduct inventory monitoring</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Manage the payrolls and human resources</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only the basic features to look for in first-class construction management software for your construction company. To ensure your business will get the most of this technology, the construction management software should be easy to use as well as easy to integrate with other existing software.</p>
<p>Additionally, the specific customization options, regular updates, and advanced features can add more to the workflow optimization and better progress of any of your projects.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25154 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Manager.jpg" alt="Construction Trends Manager" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Manager.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Manager-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Manager-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Manager-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Construction Contracts</h3>
<p>Blockchain technologies have already been revolutionizing the cryptocurrency market and are now going far beyond this scope, particularly by entering the construction industry.</p>
<p>If you’ve already done some research, you might know about their ability to create, verify and audit contracts in real-time between companies from any part of the world without third-party authentication.</p>
<p>These qualities allow construction companies to get the latest updates about what’s happening on their construction sites, as well as uncover the details of who has sent and received, completed, or approved a certain action.</p>
<p>One of the most helpful construction industry trends that will only increase their popularity in the upcoming years is the smart contracts – an automatic self-executing contract between the commissioner and the construction employees or companies providing the specific services or goods.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional paper processes, the construction contracts are able to optimize the numerous time-consuming processes such as, for instance, payment applications, as well as enhance productivity, speed up project and payment timelines and, of course, reduce the overall project costs.</p>
<p>So, with this technology implemented, companies now can streamline the straightforward two-party agreements as well as organize and manage the project’s schedule and resources with automatic updates, payments, and orders. Thus, both sides can win.</p>
<h3>Building Information Modeling (BIM)</h3>
<p>Building information modeling, also known as BIM, refers to the advanced software modeling technology that is used by architects, engineers, and contractors to collaborate on a project’s design, construction, and operation throughout its lifespan.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional drawing processes, the BIM software can not only create the realistic model of a building but also:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Store the detailed information of all the critical building’s properties</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Conduct intelligent project analysis in real-time</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Inform about the problems caused by the project changes</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Enable working on a different view of the same project model (for instance, from the architecture to engineering structure of the project)</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the building information modeling can help to address the changes in a building structure if those cause certain problems within the project construction, and help to work on a different aspect of the same model.</p>
<p>Additionally, this construction industry software can optimize numerous construction processes with the use of 3D technologies, uncover new automation opportunities, get detailed risk evaluation, and, finally, improve scheduling efficiency.</p>
<p>BIM is considered to be one of the most important construction industry trends in the upcoming decade, as it allows close collaboration between contractors and the construction workers from the concept and design modeling to the building construction and operation.</p>
<p>This technology has the highest rate of impact on the construction industry (over 19%) among the top 10 trends and innovations, <a href="https://www.startus-insights.com/innovators-guide/top-10-construction-industry-trends-innovations-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to StartUs Insights</a>. Needless to say, the world’s most famous extraordinary architecture projects created so far would not have been possible without implementing the building information modeling approach in the construction industry.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25148 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-.png" alt="Construction Trends" width="512" height="368" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-.png 512w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends--300x216.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends--450x323.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>

<h3>Construction Safety Management System</h3>
<p>Safety management system, also known as SMS, is one of the emerging construction industry trends that can greatly maximize the key workflow processes and interact with the important forms, documentations, reportings, and other critical operational information directly to the job site in digital format.</p>
<p>Thus, there’s no need for the employees to visit a centralized office to fill out the paperwork, run the reports and handle the critical documents the employees need the most.</p>
<p>Basically, the construction safety software acts as a centralized hub that stores all the documentation, licenses, and certificates needed to conduct various company operations.</p>
<p>Additionally, this platform can be also utilized as a convenient communication tool that enables efficient coordination of managers, foremen, and worksite laborers with one another remotely, regardless of their location.</p>
<p>Moreover, most of the SMS software solutions are designed for different devices, which means the important information can be accessed anytime and from nearly anywhere.</p>
<p>Some other important qualities of SMS are faster troubleshooting, more effective employee training, and the ability to create a safety-focused work culture.</p>
<p>The obvious advantages of time-saving and workflow optimization make the safety management system software one of the most powerful construction trends that can take your company or organization to a completely new level of development.</p>
<h3>Construction Robotics</h3>
<p>So far the construction industry was one of the least automated industries that utilize manual-intensive labor as a primary source of productivity. However, though the robots do not currently participate in the major stages of a building’s life cycle, there is still a high possibility to change this in the upcoming few years.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25149 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Construction-Site.jpg" alt="Construction Trends Construction Site" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Construction-Site.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Construction-Site-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Construction-Site-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Construction-Site-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The StartUp Insights reported about the high potential of construction robotics, which features a notable impact (up to 17%) on the overall industry development. In other words, being a highly automated field, the future of construction industry is poised for the robot revolution.</p>
<p>As for the time of writing, there are several large robotic projects under development, but it’s still uncertain when they’ll be fully ready for deployment: most of the construction tasks are notoriously difficult to automate.</p>
<p>However, there are still a few types of construction robots that are poised to break into the construction market at a mass scale:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">3D Printing Robots. One of the most popular construction trends that are highly employed in the various modeling processes and aimed at building large projects on-demand. This technology has been already used in the Netherlands, where the first-ever <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2021/07/19/mx3d-3d-printed-bridge-stainless-steel-amsterdam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12-meter 3D printed bridge</a> for pedestrians and cyclists was built.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Brick-Laying &amp; Masonry Robots. These robots are aimed to speed up the process of construction work without losing quality.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Demolition robots. Another frequently used type of robotic technology used today is demolition robots, the core advantages of which are their high safety and cheaper labor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though robotics are still in their early stages of development, you can now make use of the various software solutions they employ to enhance the various construction processes, like task optimization and automation, 3D modeling, and more.</p>
<h2>Average Costs for Construction Software Development</h2>
<p>Overall, there are two major ways on how companies can employ the construction industry trends: using ready-to-go software solutions or else developing their own technology that features all the critical characteristics needed for setting up an effective workflow.</p>
<p>To reduce the construction software spendings and get the full stack of the critical features, more and more companies start developing their own technological solutions instead of paying hundreds of dollars on a monthly or yearly basis.</p>
<p>The vast majority of construction companies should expect to pay from $10,000 to $50,000 on average on software that provides all the essential characteristics needed to perform various project management, financial, and human resources functions.</p>
<p>In most cases, being aware of the new trends in construction, professional software developers can also help to save up the development costs by offering and embedding only the most effective features your company really needs to enhance its performance.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25152 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Discussion.jpg" alt="Construction Trends Discussion" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Discussion.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Discussion-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Discussion-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Construction-Trends-Discussion-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

<blockquote><p>By the end of 2021, the IT spending on enterprise software is expected to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/203428/total-enterprise-software-revenue-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach over $600 billion worldwide</a>, with a CAGR of 13.6% compared to 2020. As a substantial amount of these costs are invested in the software development branch, developers are now looking for the most optimized and effective methods of software creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Different types of software development methodologies can significantly eliminate the time, resources, and costs needed for the project realization. However, due to the vast number of these methodologies currently existing, it becomes more and more challenging to pick up the best model for each specific case.</p>
<p>In this article, Intellectsoft’s best experts will analyze all the available different software development methodologies within the industry, as well as define their strong sides and possible drawbacks so you could come up with the most beneficial yet efficient approach that ideally fits your project.</p>
<p>Let’s get it started!</p>
<h2>What Is a Software Development Methodology?</h2>
<p>To understand the types of development models existing, it’s important to learn the project development basics first.</p>
<p>The software development methodology refers to the development SDLC (software development life cycle) model, which is focused on organizing beneficial yet effective project development processes from the idea and planning to front-back &amp; back-end development, testing, and software launching.</p>
<p>In other words, it is a so-called app development lifecycle that applies different formats, approaches, and techniques and helps to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Effectively organize the workflow</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Eliminate time for the project development</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Reduce the costs needed to develop a software</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Track the process of creation</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Provide a set of norms for the effective communication</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Improve the quality of the final product and more</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, there are 12 standalone types of software development methodologies that introduce different models of project creating. However, each of those has its unique advantages and possible drawbacks, so it’s essential to analyze the core gist of your project as well as learn the pick up the most effective</p>
<p>As for 2021, one of the leading technological approaches practiced for software development is DevOps methodology, which is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1233917/software-development-methodologies-practiced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used in every third project (35.9%),</a> says Statista.</p>
<p>But, in practice, it’s more efficient to review all the options available on the market and define which of the software development methodologies can fit your program best.</p>
<h2>Types of Software Development Methodologies</h2>
<p>As you already know, there are various types of different software development methodologies aimed at improving SDLC.</p>
<p>However, having reviewed them you can find out there’s no one outright winner – for each specific case, the strategy will be different based on the project’s characteristics, requirements, main goals, core features, and more.</p>
<p>Thus, the detailed comparison of software development methodologies can simplify the choice and help you to define the most winning option for each app development project individually.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Possible Drawbacks</h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The planning stage can be too challenging to organize the entire process</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Low flexibility and inability to implement the changes once the software development process is started</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The immediate changes to the project can result in additional spendings that are usually enormously high</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A longer time of delivery</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Weak for long or ongoing projects</li>

<h2>Future Hotel Technology Trends: What to Expect?</h2>
<p>Due to the recent changes in modern society &amp; people’s lifestyle, travel, tourism, and hospitality industries cannot but wonder about the hotel service’s future. All the future modifications in hotel technology are mostly based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">customer comfort level increasing</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">service optimization and development</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">workflow automation and improving</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">the Internet of Things applying</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">revenue growing</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">smart marketing and reputation management</li>
</ul>
<p><i>According to the research on </i><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1155082/coronavirus-hotels-level-of-comfort-improvement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>improving the comfortability of hotel stays by Statista</i></a><i>, 35% of respondents want their hotels to arrange contactless payment.</i></p>
<p>This hotel technology trend will increase the comfort for the hotel guests and optimize the check-in and check-out procedures and significantly improve the workflow.</p>
<p>One in four interviewees also expects the smart room keys in their hotels. That’s because being on vacation or business trip in an unfamiliar city, people often tend to lose some items like the room keys, or else forget to lock their door, etc.</p>
<p>However, by providing the smart room technology trend in the hotel industry, you can quickly solve this problem. For example, modern hotels are now recommending downloading the mobile app to get full access to their rooms. Additionally, you will save a significant sum of investments, as you no longer need to order the plastic cards or re-issue the keys.</p>
<p>These examples were demonstrated to show the hotel industry’s real need to keep up with the pace and apply new technologies to enhance their business. Nevertheless, there are many more technology trends in the hotel industry that can be useful for your business, so let’s dive in.</p>

<h2>The Main Hotel Technology Trends Nowadays</h2>
<p>At present, various hotel owners apply more and more hotel technology ideas to reach the final consumers and encourage them to book the apartment immediately.</p>
<p>Some hotel innovation ideas are common worldwide, while others may depend on the hotel’s location and targets. So, here we will look through the key points of hotel industry technology trends widely applied now.</p>
<h2>Top-Ranking Technology in Hotel Industry in 2022</h2>
<p>Smart energy management, robot delivery, and unified property management systems promise to become the most popular hotel technology trends in 2022. The reasons for this are the general tendency towards sustainability, the consequences of a global pandemic, and the constant search for better personalization tools for guests.</p>
<h3>#1 Smart Energy Management</h3>
<p>The trend towards smarter energy management has become possible with the adoption of sophisticated ML algorithms that can track thermodynamic changes and weather conditions outside and sensors that record energy control. Since the electric power industry as a whole is <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/energy-and-resources/articles/power-and-utilities-industry-outlook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forging a path</a> to a cleaner and more sustainable grid, the hospitality industry won’t lag behind.</p>
<p>From lighting to climate control, smart energy management allows hotels to save on average 20% of energy consumption, which is cost-effective for hotels.</p>
<p>Also, smart energy management is able to cut down on carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 70%. From a guests’ perspective, the hotel technology will help adjust their rooms to their preferences, creating a personalized experience that makes customers happy and more likely to return again.</p>
<h3>#2 Robot Delivering</h3>
<p>The COVID pandemic introduced the need for social distancing, and this norm accelerated the adoption of robots in hotels. Combined with the constant search for opportunities to create unique experiences, the technology will let hotel owners create a safe and fun recreation space. In 2022, the main applications of robots are service delivery and collecting items for customers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24997 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-Resort.jpg" alt="Hotel Trends Resort" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-Resort.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-Resort-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-Resort-600x398.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotel-Trends-Resort-450x299.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>For example, the robotic waiter could be designed to deliver food and drinks to guests, which would free up servers to take orders or perform other tasks while still providing guests with their service.</p>
<p>This means that even if a hotel has dozens of floors and rooms, the owners will no longer need to hire tons of people to deliver food and supplies. Humans can provide more valuable input, like answering questions from guests who interact with these robots and ensuring customer care service takes place.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive new technologies in hotels is robots that complete various tasks traditionally performed by humans. For example, the FlyZoo hotel by Alibaba has used robots to occupy the room service staff, provide the guests with all the necessary information, clean the rooms, and automate the routine processes to the extent possible.</p>
<h3>#3 Unified Property Management Systems</h3>
<p>In 2022, hotel properties are expected to move to a unified <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/hotel-property-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">property management system</a>, a software type that assists in automating daily operations and administrative tasks in a hotel.</p>
<p>Moreover, the unified in-hotel experience means guests will be able to interact with hotels across many different brands using one mobile app.</p>
<p>The hotel technology creates a united network between various in-hotel properties, with all key information collected in one system.</p>
<p>Guests can enjoy the intuitive experience of finding and booking their ideal recreation easily, seeing immediately its location, detailed description, and availability. This way, the booking process should take just a few taps from start to finish.</p>
<h2>Hotel Guest Room Technology Trends</h2>
<p>One of the first things that make the visitors’ first impression is the room they will stay in. That is why hotels are now focusing on improving the customer experience, accommodation, service, and facilities.</p>
<p><b>Here are the top </b><b>hotel technology trends</b><b>, which you can consider for improving the hotel performance. </b></p>
<h3>#4 Mobile Keys</h3>
<p>Needless to say, everyone has lost their stuff at least once in their life. And when it comes to the small things like keys or cards – the numbers might get even higher.</p>
<p>However, you can easily get rid of that headache with the smart keys installed in the app. These keys provide comfortable access to the visitors’ rooms.</p>
<p>The hotel technology includes different features like booking a restaurant, paying some extra bills, or reminding about personal preferences to provide the perfect experience for any client.</p>
<h3>#5 Smart Rooms</h3>
<p>Since our world is going digital, many technologies are created to make the routine easier and comfortable. For instance, voice control, facial recognition, and mobile control can put the visitors’ personal experience to the next level and feel them stay here a little longer or come back later.</p>
<p>Just imagine yourself entering your room after the tiring strolling on the streets of the unfamiliar city or the working conference. Along with your command “tired,” the voice assistant will instantly prepare the relaxing bath, offer some TV series to watch, etc. Sound like a great idea for your hotel innovation, isn’t it?</p>
<h2>American Hotel Technology Trends</h2>
<p>In America, the customer-centric model of business has already transformed from a trend to a necessity. Simultaneously, the hotel founders are still interested in their business optimization to make the most of it.</p>
<p>Here are the leading hotel technology trends in America, which are still on the top in 2021.</p>
