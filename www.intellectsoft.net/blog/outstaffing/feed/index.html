										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To ensure the success of a software development team, it’s critical to make a detailed check-up on its multiple performance aspects regularly. Of course, software development companies want to find out the progress developers have made, what goals have been achieved, what issues have been resolved, and the challenges that are still in progress, as well as the overall level of each employee&#8217;s productivity and expertise.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25428" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Engineer-Performance-Review.jpeg" alt="Software Engineer Performance Review" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Engineer-Performance-Review.jpeg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Engineer-Performance-Review-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Engineer-Performance-Review-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Engineer-Performance-Review-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Engineer-Performance-Review-450x300.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>At the same time, this information helps developers and software engineers to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, yet define the most effective ways to improve their performance. However, due to the variety of factors involved, the performance assessment can be really challenging to conduct.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explain why software engineer performance reviews matter, how to effectively measure the productivity of a developer, and what are the major challenges of running a performance review for software engineer. Along with that, you’ll be able to find out the most important performance metrics and uncover the best practices of conducting developer performance reviews.</p>
<h2>Why Are Developers’ Performance Reviews Important?</h2>
<p>When it comes to managing a software development team, every company is concerned about the ways to improve their employee performance: not only will it help to <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/proven-ways-to-reduce-software-development-costs-without-losing-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhance the workflow and reduce costs</a>, but it can also impact the client relationship and the quality of products/services delivered.</p>
<p>By setting up the software engineer goals and evaluating the progress of each worker, it becomes much easier to define the ways how to enhance their performance. Here are some of the most common examples of when companies start considering the performance review for software engineer:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Your team tends to miss deadlines or create low-value products. Both these aspects not only show the poor performance of developers but also hits the company’s reputation as well.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Developers have the signs of burnout. A recent study by Haystack shows that <a href="https://haystack-books.s3.amazonaws.com/Study+to+understand+the+impact+of+COVID-19+on+Software+Engineers+-+Full+Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 83% of software developers</a> suffer from workplace burnout, which is in over half of all the cases caused by a high workload. The other probable triggers are inefficient processes and unclear performance goals for software engineers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Your employees can’t find themselves in your company’s structure. If your company hasn’t set up the career goals for software engineer, developer, and other employees, they become confused with how they can develop their expertise.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Lack of feedback and communication. The nature of their occupation had made most of the developers isolated from the other departments. So, to ensure your employees can discuss their progress and the current state of the team, you can gain more insights on setting up the most effective software engineer goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>When any of these, or some similar signs are detected, immediate implementation of software engineer performance review is no longer an option but a necessity. It will help you to gain priceless insights on the current team state, understand the progress, the strong sides of each member, and the aspects that require some input. Additionally, you’ll be able to provide up-to-date recommendations for software engineers and the most effective ways for their devs based on the current performance results.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25425 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Engineer-Performance-Review-Dialogue.jpg" alt="Software Engineer Performance Review Dialogue" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Engineer-Performance-Review-Dialogue.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Engineer-Performance-Review-Dialogue-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Engineer-Performance-Review-Dialogue-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Engineer-Performance-Review-Dialogue-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>What Are the Types of Software Engineer Performance Reviews?</h2>
<p>Many companies utilize software engineer performance review template examples, with each of those focusing on different performance metrics and business models. To define the most effective option that will ideally work for your enterprise, let’s now review the peculiarities of each in detail.</p>
<h3>Manager Reviews</h3>
<p>Manager reviews are commonly used in small-scale organizations. In this model, managers are required to conduct incorruptible and consistent reviews to evaluate the engine performance.</p>
<p>When giving feedback, managers are also expected to offer the most beneficial strategy to enhance the developer’s performance and resolve their challenges. In most cases, it includes the tools, approaches, and resources to study, such as mastering an additional programming language, completing the training, or taking advanced software courses.</p>
<h3>Self-Appraisals</h3>
<p>The self-appraisal model is another software engineer performance review example that is commonly used for evaluating employee productivity. It implies conducting a thorough self-analysis of each of the metrics to help managers get a better idea of the overall performance and how it can be improved.</p>
<p>However, just like any other processes related to self-evaluation, in most cases it contains bias: people can be either too critical to what they’re doing or excessively confident about their performance.</p>
<h3>Peer Reviews</h3>
<p>This category is considered to be the most accurate model of performance review for software engineers, as it allows each of the team members and colleagues from the same department to act as a reviewer handling the assessment.</p>
<p>As a rule, the reviewers have spent most of their time with a software engineer that is being tested, worked on the same projects, etc but is commonly conducted anonymously.</p>
<p>Overall, this gives a great advantage to access the reviewee’s capabilities and define the ways for improvement, while anonymity encourages openness and better engagement into the reviewing process without hitting the workplace relationships.</p>
<h3>360-Degree Assessment</h3>
<p>Mixing up two or more evaluation models introduced above can enhance the process of software engineer performance review. This type of review implies analyzing multiple assessment sources, thus getting a more detailed review of the employee performance.</p>
<p>Usually, it’s categorized and delivered as feedback for each of the developers and enables getting detailed insights regarding the strong and weak points, yet allows setting up more accurate software engineer goals.</p>
<h2>How to Effectively Measure the Performance of a Developer</h2>
<p>Having uncovered the software engineer performance review examples, it’s now time to figure out which metrics you should include to get the most informative assessment. The most critical focus points for software engineer review usually includes:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Code Quality. </b>Analyzing the expertise and professionalism based on the job done.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Productivity. </b>Defining how fast a developer can write code</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Teamwork. </b>Understanding the ability to be a team player and cooperate with others</li>
</ul>
<p>These performance metrics can be also analyzed from a customer-centric perspective, which represents the major concerns of your company:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What’s the input of a software engineer into reaching the project’s objectives?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How long will the project outcome be relevant to consumers?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How do the employee&#8217;s skills and experience help other colleagues to grow?</li>
</ul>
<p>With these practices in mind, you’re more than likely to get a clear idea of your employee performance, regardless of how long they’re working with you. Thus, you can always guide the developers from the employment and onboarding right to senior positions, help them to grow and develop as experts while enhancing your business performance.</p>
<h2>Major Challenges of Reviewing the Developers’ Performance</h2>
<p>Though the recent studies by Betterworks show that after adopting the continuous performance feedback, companies have significantly outperformed competition at a <strong>24% higher rate</strong>, only a handful of enterprises started implementing the employee performance reviews into their workflow.</p>
<p>Usually, it is related to the challenges this process implies, which in fact can benefit the review process improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Biased opinion. </b>Any performance review will always depend on the reviewer’s perception of the workflow processes, which can help to get a better idea of the other team members’ results and personal competencies. With this said, you’ll get a “second opinion” that can help to uncover the valuable insights that were overlooked during the review.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Evaluation as a team or individual.</b> If you’re torn between these two options, it’s more reasonable to set up personal goals for each developer with a huge focus on how these objectives can help your team to develop.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lack of performance assessment. </b>It’s not enough to conduct a performance review only to get the results. Apart from the detailed research and analysis of the employee performance, you should always provide feedback on how it can be improved, otherwise, it doesn’t make any sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we’ve learned the major challenges taken from the software engineer performance review examples, it’s time to master the best practices for running the assessment.</p>

<h2>7 Tips to Effectively Conduct a Developer Performance Review</h2>
<p>Without any doubt, performance evaluations can encourage people to perform better and document the poor performance if it’s necessary. This approach helps to effectively invest the resources and time into your best workers and eliminate those that can’t meet the company’s requirements and objectives.</p>
<p>Here is some great advice on how to set up a successful performance review system for your developers.</p>
<h3>#1 Set the Effective Criteria</h3>
<p>One of the core aspects you should consider when making a performance review system for your developers is defining the right criteria of assessment. Along with the core ones, we’ve mentioned above (code quality, productivity, and teamwork), there are more specific ones that are commonly included in the review:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Number of tasks completed</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Lines of code written</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Code readability</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Number of bugs</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Test coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, it’s possible to evaluate the value of your software engineers by understanding their code jobs responsibilities, such as punctuality, proactivity, level of engagement, user empathy, initiativeness, proactivity, willingness to learn, and many others.</p>
<h3>#2 Measure the Speed</h3>
<p>Along with the aspects needed to get the work done, the second most important aspect that is always mentioned in software engineer performance review examples is speed and iteration.</p>
<p>This criterion helps to understand the time needed to handle iterative software development, which is exceptionally important while dealing with large teams working on the same project. The major task of a <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/software-developer-vs-software-engineer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software developer</a> here is to not only write great code but also deliver this specific task in certain time frames.</p>
<h3>#3 Include Core Review Process</h3>
<p>Another important process that shouldn’t be overlooked either is the code quality checkup. Even if delivering the code fast, its value still can be undermined if it requires thorough reviews, debugging, or some lines rewriting from scratch. Additionally, it may impact the overall project due to the delivery time delays.</p>
<p>For this reason, you should also include the code review process – when the code is examined by someone else and not by the authors themselves. It will help you to avoid the time-consuming checkups while running a project, yet is a great way to maintain the high-quality of development processes.</p>
<h3>#4 Improve the Communication</h3>
<p>Communication and interaction with the team are other essential aspects for setting up a productive workflow among developers. According to Plumb,<strong> <a href="https://pumble.com/learn/communication/communication-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 86% of employees</a> </strong>report a lack of effective collaboration and interaction as a result of their project failures. On the contrary, those teams featuring great communication can <strong>increase productivity by nearly 25%</strong>.</p>
<p>While communicating, engineers can discuss the ideas and brainstorm the most effective solutions for a specific project, as well as troubleshoot the issues. Additionally, it can enhance the experience exchange with their peers, team leads, and stakeholders which benefits to learning some new skills in practice.</p>
<h3>#5 Perform Evaluations Consistently</h3>
<p>No matter which type of performance assessment you’ve selected, it’s essential to run these on a regular basis. With all the benefits each model features, your managers can clearly understand the value of each employee, separating the great developers from those you shouldn’t waste the time and resources on.</p>
<p>In addition, making the annual reviews will allow you to evaluate the progress of your developers and get up-to-date insights on their performance.</p>
<p>Commonly, there are three main kinds of cadences used for performance reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Annual performance assessment</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Quarterly performance snapshot</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Weekly check-in</li>
</ul>
<h3>#6 Decide Who to Include</h3>
<p>Software developer performance review process is a complex process that implies multiple aspects analysis. As a human resource manager, you still may lack some expertise in specific criteria measuring: reviewing the code or analyzing the reports for different projects.</p>
<p>However, there is a great chance to ask colleagues from other departments to participate – that’s one of the most accurate illustrations of 360-degree reviews.</p>
<p>Thus, you will be able not only to get detailed feedback from the people that possess more expertise and authority within the scope but also can get explanations regarding the performance issues and their most effective solutions, and even get some great comments on how to improve the performance reviews for your employees.</p>
<h3>#7 Review and Improve the Review Process Regularly</h3>
<p>To make sure you’re getting the most accurate results from your reviews, don’t forget to always keep the review system up-to-date. This means analyzing the most recent round of performance reviews, defining the shortcomings that still need some improvements before starting the next round.</p>
<p>This method will not only help you to run the process smoothly but also ensure they’re targeting the most critical aspects of software developers’ workflow, deliver value for the performance analysis, and efficiently set up objectives.</p>

<h2>Summing It Up</h2>
<p>As you can see, software engineer performance review is one of the most effective approaches to evaluate the performance of your developers’ team and help them to build up the right strategy for their future growth.</p>
<p>Along with that, setting up the software engineer goals can benefit not only the employee workflow but also the entire company’s development, as it allows optimizing various internal processes of the enterprise, delivering the best products/services, and helping it to get more competitive on the market as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the latest research by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the projected change in employment for occupations in the software development field is showing <strong>a 22% increase for the period 2020 to 2030</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Such tremendous career growth is caused by the impressive development of this industry: by 2027, the Application Development Software Market is <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/application-development-software-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projected to reach </a><strong><a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/application-development-software-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,039.89 billion</a>, growing at a CAGR of 25.54% from 2020 to 2027</strong>, according to the Verified Market Research data.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25391 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/healthcare-artificial-intelligence-solutions-1-min-1024x713.png" alt="app development statistics" width="1024" height="713" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/healthcare-artificial-intelligence-solutions-1-min-1024x713.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/healthcare-artificial-intelligence-solutions-1-min-300x209.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/healthcare-artificial-intelligence-solutions-1-min-768x535.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/healthcare-artificial-intelligence-solutions-1-min-1536x1069.png 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/healthcare-artificial-intelligence-solutions-1-min-2048x1426.png 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/healthcare-artificial-intelligence-solutions-1-min-600x418.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/healthcare-artificial-intelligence-solutions-1-min-450x313.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/healthcare-artificial-intelligence-solutions-1-min-1000x696.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>However, when it comes to hiring a professional for your software development project, you can find software development and software engineer experts that can be considered for performing the app development. Are these two roles similar?</p>
<p>To understand what is the difference between software developer and software engineer yet be able to define which one will surely fit your software development project, it’s essential to start with a detailed overview of the main responsibilities and tasks performed within each position.</p>
<p>In this article, Intellectsoft’s best experts will make a detailed overview of a software developer vs software engineer and explain how to select the professional who will work best for your business needs and purposes.</p>
<h2>What Does a Software Engineer Do?</h2>
<p>Simply put, a software engineer is a professional who applies the principles of software engineering for designing, developing, maintaining, testing and evaluating computer software.</p>
<p>As a rule, this position implies strong teamwork with other project members, as the software engineer works with the separate components of the hardware system, works on creating the tools and solutions to develop the specific software, and also searches for potential opportunities to improve the software. Unlike software developers that work on a limited scale, software engineers resolve the issues on a much larger scale.</p>
<blockquote><p>Having analyzed the global searching trends for “software engineer”, we can see that the interest in this position among <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=software%20developer,software%20engineer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s searchers shows</a><strong> 76 out of 100 points</strong>, which means this trend is still in the peak period of its popularity as of February 2022.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25368 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Office.jpg" alt="Software Developer vs Software Engineer Office" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Office.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Office-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Office-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>What Does a Software Developer Do?</h2>
<p>On the contrary, the software developer is the professional responsible for building cross-platform software for different types of devices. Typically, they write code from scratch, with the ready-to-go application at the output.</p>
<p>The most common examples of this software are the diverse number of various desktop and mobile apps for different operating systems: the applications like Instagram, Facebook, Photoshop or MS Word are the ones that come to mind first.</p>
<p>Unlike the software engineer position, this job is primarily a solitary activity, so the developer works not on the separate program components but on the complete program structure overall.</p>
<p>Software developers commonly utilize pre-made tools and frameworks to build the software. However, they have a much-limited scale of issue-resolving compared to the engineers.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=software%20developer,software%20engineer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s searching trends</a> for the term “software developer” are half as much as we’ve got for the engineer position: as of February 2022, it shows only <strong>33 points out of 100</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, this trend has never reached more than 50 points in the last 5 years, which only emphasizes that there is a huge difference between software engineering and software development processes.</p>
<p>Does this mean the software engineer position is better than a software developer? Let’s find this out by making a detailed comparison of software developers vs software engineers!</p>
<h2>What Is the Difference Between Software Engineer and Software Developer?</h2>
<p>Though both specializations refer to one scope of software development, in fact, software developer and software engineer occupations are not similar. To find out the difference between software developer and software engineer, let’s analyze the major aspects of each occupation separately.</p>

<h3>Software Developers</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The typical <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entry-level education</a> for this occupation is Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology or Computer programming, where the Software Development specializations are studied.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Software development is primarily a solitary activity that requires developing the overall application itself.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A software developer is responsible for working with the separate aspects within the software project development process.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">This specialist creates and delivers a complete program from scratch.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Software developers perform the issue resolving processes, similar to the software engineers, but on a more limited scale. For this reason, they tend to be more creative in generating solutions that can be embedded into the software project.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The expert in software development will use the pre-made tools for delivering the software solutions for the web, mobile, and desktop.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software Engineers</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The typical entry-level education for this occupation is a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Software Development, but the degrees in Software Engineering are rather the add-on benefits than the essential requirements.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Software engineering is primarily a team activity, which implies high engagement in collaboration during the development process.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In this position, the professional is involved in the complete process of software development.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A software engineer is responsible for the separate components of the software and closely cooperates with other professionals to build and deliver the ready-to-go system.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The working style of software engineers implies resolving large-scaled issues, and are less involved in considering creative solutions. Instead, they’re more systematic and work with the real concerns.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A software engineer professional is the one who creates the tools which will be further used for the software development process.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this said, the difference between a software developer vs software engineer becomes more than obvious. Now you can clearly understand the major aspects, tasks, and responsibilities of each professional, and start considering which one – software developer or software engineer will better fit your business needs.</p>
<h2>Software Developer vs Software Engineer – How to Define What Specialist You Need for Your Project?</h2>
<p>Having compared these two jobs, it’s now time to find the answer to the main question – software engineer vs software developer which is better exactly for your business? Here are some essential aspects you should ask yourself before making up the final decision.</p>
<h3>#1 Will This Professional Join Your Team of Developers or Perform the Project Alone?</h3>
<p>If you need a software development expert that will cooperate with other team members, you can hire both a software engineer and a software developer. However, if the project is expected to be delivered by one expert only, it’s better to<a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/top-reasons-to-hire-software-developers-in-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> hire a software developer</a> – this professional can perform the design and program implementation processes by adding creativity.</p>
<h3>#2 Will Your Project Utilize the Tools That Already Exist or Needs Creating New Ones Instead?</h3>
<p>If your project implies creating completely new tech approaches and development tools, then it’s more reasonable to hire a software engineer – a person who applies the engineering principles to the process of software development. However, in case it’s possible to use the premade development tools for your project – the software developer is your best option to choose!</p>
<h3>#3 Will This Person Be Engaged in the Specific Development Stages or the Entire Process of Software Building?</h3>
<p>If you want a professional that will participate in the entire process of the application development, it’s also more beneficial to select the software developer instead of a software engineer, as this expert can effectively participate in each stage of software building yet features better creativity, which is surely great for any project.</p>
<p>Instead, if you want the person to resolve some larger issues and the one that won’t be required to contribute in every stage – choose a software engineer!</p>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-25371 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Team.jpg" alt="Software Developer vs Software Engineer Team" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Team.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Team-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Team-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Team-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h3>
<h3>#4 Will This Expert Operate on a Bigger Scale or Perform the Functions on a Small Scale Only?</h3>
<p>If the upcoming project requires a person that operates the large-scale tasks, it’s better to consider hiring a software engineer, and ultimately, when you want the professional to carry out the engineering functions on a smaller scale – it’s more reasonable to choose a software developer!</p>
<p>You’ll probably want to hire a software engineer if your software project requires a person that:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Features the ability to work in teams</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Has the advanced problem-solving skills</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Possesses strong interpersonal and communication skills</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Has expertise in computer programming and coding</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Is focused on the object-oriented design</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s better to consider hiring a software developer specialist if you’re looking for the person that:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Possesses advanced knowledge in cloud computing, data structure, and data algorithms</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Has the ability to learn and develop his or her skills</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Features Git and GitHub hard skills</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Knows the source code editors, can perform debugging, code refactoring and syntax highlighting</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Will complete the project alone (no teamwork needed)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, having compared software developer vs software engineer, you can now understand which one will be the right option for your software development project.</p>
<h2>Summing Up the ​​Difference Between Software Developer and Software Engineer</h2>
<p>Having compared the position of software developer vs software engineer, you can now clearly understand what is the difference between software engineer and software developer. Additionally, there are a few aspects to point out as well.</p>
<p>First of all, these jobs are not similar, as they use different approaches and perform slightly different tasks for developing the software products: when a software engineer works on the separate app components within a team, the software developer alone employs the specific tools and frames to build the app from scratch. So, none of them has better or worse skills, nevertheless, their responsibilities and tasks differ!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25369 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Process.jpg" alt="Software Developer vs Software Engineer Process" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Process-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Process-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Software-Developer-vs-Software-Engineer-Process-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

<p>In the given circumstances, staying up to date with the trends in software development is a big part of being a good developer, and it’s important to keep tabs on the most popular backend frameworks that developers are using and adjust to the new requirements fast.</p>
<p>This article covers 7 backend frameworks that are popular in 2022, along with some helpful tips about which one might be right for you based on your experience level and other factors.</p>
<h2>What Are Backend Frameworks?</h2>
<p>In essence, a backend framework provides a standardized, reusable structure for creating applications. A framework can speed up development by providing ready-made solutions for common tasks, such as connecting databases or allowing user logins.</p>
<p>Much like WordPress or Drupal can streamline a website’s creation process, a backend framework makes it easy to build complex applications quickly.</p>
<h2>Why Use Backend Frameworks? Their Importance</h2>
<p>Developers can use frameworks to save time when building new software. Even more, a backend framework provides an architecture that encompasses all necessary components of your platform, which makes a web service possible.</p>
<p>When you consider what it takes to develop every part of a web service yourself, it’s easy to see why so many companies choose to use these technologies. And the list of the most popular backend frameworks appeared as the result of frequent usage of 7 software architecture approaches that have proved their effectiveness and flexibility by 2022.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25313 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Backend-Frameworks-Process.jpg" alt="Backend Frameworks Process" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Backend-Frameworks-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Backend-Frameworks-Process-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Backend-Frameworks-Process-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Backend-Frameworks-Process-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>7 Most Popular Backend Frameworks in 2022</h2>
<p>There are several different types of frameworks available for developers on various platforms such as .NET, Java, Python, and Ruby. Choosing which one will work best for your business depends upon its specific needs at any given moment.</p>
<p>For example, some platforms offer more flexibility to apply different features to different applications. Other considerations may include how big your organization is and how much support is provided by each provider. You may also want to look into whether or not your current team uses a particular programming language so that the framework you’ve chosen has the relevant language and can be adopted.</p>
<p>Once you have reviewed these factors, you should have a better idea of which direction you would like to take next with regard to selecting an appropriate backend framework.</p>
<p>And our guide here will help reveal the advantages and disadvantages of most popular backend frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Django</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Laravel</li>
<li>ASP.NET</li>
<li>Flutter</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
<li>Golang</li>
</ul>
<h2>Django from Python</h2>
<p>Founded by two Python developers, Django’s creators envisioned it as a toolkit for building scalable web applications quickly. And they certainly hit their mark with millions of developers around the world using Django today. The framework has undergone several major changes over its lifetime, however, ensuring that it stays up-to-date with industry trends and stays relevant.</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
<p>Though it’s been around for almost two decades, Ruby on Rails continues to be one of, if not the most, popular backend frameworks today. Its biggest advantage is that it scales well as your business grows — in fact, it was designed with growth and scalability in mind. As a result, Ruby on Rails can support your project over time with minimal coding changes or redesigns; by nature, it’s very malleable.</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Speed:</b> Almost every part of your software can have its pre-built plugin or module, so building it will be really fast.</li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tools for testing</b>: Laravel has PHP support and phpunit.xml file that enable simulation of users’ behavior for testing purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Complicated</b>: It’s hard to learn Laravel due to numerous complex and strict rules you need to follow.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lack of support</b>: Due to the growing problems, support from Laravel is not always available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ASP.NET</h2>
<p>As a Windows-based most popular backend framework for web development, ASP.NET was developed by Microsoft back in 2000 and is primarily based on C#. Nowadays, it’s constantly being upgraded with new features that come directly from Microsoft. As a consequence, Visual Studio plays an essential role because of its cross-platform compatibility.</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Minimum coding</b>: Most functions are pre-configured in ASP.NET core already, which facilitates and speeds up development.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cross-platform</b>: Based on C#, ASP.NET works well for making cross-platform web apps. Also, despite being very popular in enterprise applications, it’s also quite customizable when needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lack of control</b>: Developers’ freedom and creativity are limited by Microsoft’s rules and control over their actions when they work with ASP.NET.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Price for licensing</b>: Not only additional but also basic Core modules require licensing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Flutter</h2>
<p>Flutter is the most popular backend framework for making apps for Android and iOS. Flutter’s biggest advantage is that it allows you to use a single codebase, which means you spend less time maintaining two different apps. This also means any changes you make only have to be made once, and they will instantly appear on both platforms.</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Wide applicability</b>: Flutter is the best backend framework for mobile development. At the same time, its application is not limited to Android and iOS only — you can use it for building apps on Windows, Linux, Mac, and Google Fuchsia.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Fast changes</b>: You don’t need to reboot an app to test updates as Flutter allows changes on the running code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Compatibility problems</b>: Flutter overhauls with the release of iOS and Android upgrades.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Golang</h2>
<p>Go is a simple, clean, efficient programming language created at Google. It’s so popular that it’s already supported by major cloud providers like Heroku and AWS. It’s hard to find Golang among the most common backend frameworks yet, but its popularity is increasing and <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/nodejs-vs-golang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s compatible with NodeJS already</a>.</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Concurrency</b>: Golang is a great fit for large software projects, as its lightweight thread communication mechanism handles running several functions at once.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Scalability</b>: With goroutines, Go handles parallel threads effectively and reliably.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The IT industry has always been changing rapidly and the current pandemic situation has only accelerated this process: the emerging trends we see today will probably no longer matter in the upcoming years, while the others will only increase in their popularity.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25278 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Process.jpg" alt="Reduce Software Development Costs Process" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Process-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Process-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Process-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In general, today’s software engineering trends are strongly related to the optimization and automation of the developing processes, security, and compliance improvements, and, finally, software development cost reduction – one of the core aspects that plays a tremendous role in IT products development.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-10-20-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-exceed-4-trillion-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner’s latest forecast</a> shows that worldwide IT spending is projected to total $4.5 trillion in 2022, with a CAGR of 5.1% from 2021, and up to 9% of these costs will be invested into software development, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/203428/total-enterprise-software-revenue-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, along with the increasing investment tendency, more and more companies start searching for effective ways to optimize software development costs and get the most profitable outcomes from their projects.</p>
<p>In this article, Intellectsoft will explain the major factors that impact the cost of software development, as well as share the profitable tips for reducing the spending on software development and calculating software development costs.</p>
<h2>What Factors Define Software Development Costs?</h2>
<p>First of all, before you start learning the most critical aspects that influence the final cost of software development, it’s essential to understand which factors really matter in the process of digital product development.</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, the software development pricing is formed depending on the specific features your product has to include, its scope and size, delivery timelines, and many more.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25275 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Contract.jpg" alt="Reduce Software Development Costs Contract" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Contract.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Contract-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Contract-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Contract-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Nevertheless, being aware of all these elements will help you not only to better understand the process but also to calculate software development cost and find the most profitable approaches to their optimization.</p>
<p>So, the major factors that make an average cost of software development are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Project Scope &amp; Its Complexity. This aspect describes the overall development environment used to build your app, including time and workforce required, the in-process challenges developers face, and effort input. Additionally, you should also consider the unexpected events and security measures, yet understand that the leverage-cutting technologies will surely require higher investments.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Software Functionality. Get ready to pay more for the feature-rich software solutions, as it not only requires more time but also much more effort, complex processes, innovative approaches, and detailed testing to deliver a high-quality product.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">UI/UX Design Implemented. Any technology should be wrapped into an engaging design and clear navigation and intuitive interface to get more people encouraged to come back, so you will surely want to make a custom design instead of using standard templates, and deliver the best experience to its users and provide the highest level of usability.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Software Integration. Making your product more agile and compatible with other popular services, apps, and technologies used today can put the software on a completely new level and enhance its competitiveness on the market. However, integrating the technologies like blockchain, IoT, supply chain management, CRM or other solutions will naturally boost the software development costs.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Human Resources Involved. Last but not less important is to mind the workforces needed to get your project done. To develop even the most simple MVP, you’ll need not only developers but also designers, QA specialists, testers, project managers, and many more. And, their level of experience will also impact the final software development cost!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you know all the essential software cost factors and can conduct a thorough software development cost estimation for your upcoming projects. However, before getting started, let’s review the effective tips on how these costs can be reduced!</p>

<h2>Tips to Cut Off the Cost of Software Development</h2>
<p>According to BCG, cost optimization today is an urgent priority for nearly every company. Amortization of software development costs is no longer an option but a necessity, as it can significantly save up the costs required to deliver first-class software products without losing on their quality or time.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can help to optimize the app delivery process and ensure your company is utilizing the most profitable approaches for the project’s successful development and use.</p>
<h3>Outsource Software Development</h3>
<p>One of the core ways to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/09/08/how-to-reduce-software-development-costs/?sh=1958d38135b1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce software development costs</a> is by employing the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/product-team-on-demand-forget-everything-you-know-about-software-outsourcing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsourcing model</a>, which so far remains the most effective and popular software engineering method. Why? IT outsourcing enables a wide range of different opportunities for the companies, as they become able to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Access the large pool of skilled specialists</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Get better workflow flexibility, regardless of the location of your outsourced team</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Achieve greater productivity while saving costs on the employee training</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Focus on other essential business activities (which is extremely important for the companies in non-IT niches)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Win on the knowledge of the industry and innovations</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Employ first-class technologies in your projects</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Reduce the risks of project failure</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>These are only a few benefits companies can get with software development outsourcing, and according to the recent research by Deloitte, nearly 60% of companies prefer this approach due to its cost-efficiency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unlike the traditional hiring model where you need to hire and train new employees, spending lots of time, effort, and resources, the outsourcing model involves a dedicated team of developers that features enough expertise in the scope and can start working on the project delivery from day one.</p>
<p>Additionally, outsourcing is an effective solution for software development costs tax treatment, as you can search for professional software vendors in countries with much lower tax rates in terms of IT development, such as Ukraine, for example.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25280 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Team.jpg" alt="Reduce Software Development Costs Team" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Team.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Team-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Team-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Team-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Plan the Project Objectives &amp; Finalize Requirements</h3>
<p>Another proven way to achieve capitalized software development costs is to always provide detailed project scope and requirements to your developers, no matter whether you’re working with an in-house team or decided to outsource to IT specialists.</p>
<p>When it comes to launching any project, you will need to clearly state the scope, goals, and essential features you’ll expect to get with the project delivery.</p>
<p>This approach not only impacts the costs but also the overall time developers will need to get the project done, yet avoid missing deadlines and spending money on doing the same tasks.</p>
<h3>Launch an MVP &amp; Collect Feedback</h3>
<p>One of the most common mistakes that experienced companies and prospective startups do when working on their software project is overlooking the MVP launching stage and targeting full-fledged software directly.</p>
<p>In fact, working on minimum value software products helps to eliminate time and resources needed for the full product development, while providing valuable insights regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The success of your final product</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Various performance issues detected during the utilization process</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The product relevance for your potential users</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Different aspects to be improved: features, bugs, and more, as well as provide feedback regarding the software usability</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, MVP can show the potential of your upcoming product, accelerate the time and costs for the actual development, and even attract investors!</p>
<h3>Involve QA Specialist</h3>
<p>A good option to achieve capitalized software development costs is to employ a professional quality assurance specialist that can track the development process, analyze the product performance and ensure the product doesn’t have any bugs or errors. The major reasons why companies hire professional quality assurance experts include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Saving up on time and money without the quality loss</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Ensuring the product quality and its competitiveness on the market</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">In-time vulnerabilities detection &amp; enhanced software security</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Guaranteeing the best user experience</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Business reputation protection</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the professional QA specialist can provide full assistance in the early stages of the product development, thus eliminating the chances to get tons of performance issues that may impact the final costs and delivery time.</p>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-25277 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Papers.jpg" alt="Reduce Software Development Costs Papers" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Papers.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Papers-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Papers-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Papers-450x253.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h3>
<h3>Consider Cross-Platform Development</h3>
<p>If you’re targeting users on several operating systems, considering the cross-platform development approach can be also a great opportunity for amortization of software development costs!</p>
<p>This method implies the usage of specific cross-platform development tools like React Native, Xamarin, or Flutter and enables the building of a single application that works perfectly on different operating systems and devices.</p>
<p>So, instead of writing multiple code variations specifically for each operating system or device, you’ll get a <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/agile-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more agile product</a>. Along with cutting out the spending, your company will also win a lot on the time of product development!</p>
<h3>Implement the Right Methodology</h3>
<p>Using the proper type of methodology is simply a must to organize an effective software development process. Based on the major goals and requirements of your project, this practice is basically a “backbone” of the entire development process that can impact the costs, time, and resources needed to deliver a high-quality software solution.</p>
<p>In most cases today, businesses prefer using the Agile method of software development – the approach that enables issue detecting and elimination in the early stages of software development. However, if you’re searching for the one that will work best for you – feel free to review our recent post regarding <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/top-12-software-development-methodologies-you-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 Software Development Methodologies</a> and what projects they fit best.</p>
<p>The properly defined methodology enables providing better estimates, delivering stable systems, keeping the companies in the loop about the latest project news, and ensuring software engineers have a clear understanding of the entire development process in general, not only the stages they’re responsible for.</p>
<p>Once you choose the most beneficial methodology and conduct a thorough software development cost estimation, you’ll be able to see that this approach is an integral part of any software product delivery.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To sum up, it’s more than possible to optimize the software development cost and boost the project performance without losing on the quality: from hiring a dedicated team of developers and reconsidering the project planning processes to entrusting the entire project delivery to the professional <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software development services</a> outsourced.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25274 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Coding.jpg" alt="Reduce Software Development Costs Coding" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Coding.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Coding-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Coding-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Reduce-Software-Development-Costs-Coding-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

<p>Once the clients identify which experts, their level of expertise, and how many developers they need, it’s time to search for the IT staff augmentation services that can deliver them with such.</p>
<p>The more detailed and clearer the job description the client will provide, the higher are the chances to quickly hire the right IT specialists.</p>
<p>When the list of potential candidates is delivered, companies usually test candidates and provide feedback on their results. The final stage is the interview and employment of the candidates that will fit most of your company’s requirements and needs.</p>
<h3>#3 Types of Staff Augmentation</h3>
<p>In general, IT staff augmentation comes in many types that differ depending on the major client company’s needs and goals.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Traditional (standard) staffing – fits all types of projects</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Specialized staffing and consulting – for the rare skillset &amp; exclusive requirements searching</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Master vendor staffing – for the cost-saving, quick, bulk-hiring</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Independent contracting – for the immediate staffing without the clear scope</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Gig platforms – for quick hiring &amp; short tasks completion</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">On-demand talent platforms – for extra quick hiring with no hassle</li>
</ul>
<h3>#4 Why Should Companies Use Staff Augmentation?</h3>
<p>One of the most critical aspects that impact companies using IT staff augmentation services is the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-organization-blog/the-great-attrition-what-to-do-about-the-labor-shortage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">labor shortage</a>, according to McKinsey.</p>
<blockquote><p>Recent research has proven that <strong><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis/charting-the-path-to-the-next-normal/mind-the-skills-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most companies worldwide – 87%</a></strong> – are aware that they either already experience the skills gap or will have one within a few years. Here at Intellectsoft, we have been similarly overwhelmed with projects such as this — mainly due to the booming demand from customers and the tech talent gap that seems to persist globally. <strong>Our own figure is 68%</strong> that is only confirming this trend, so the Intellectsoft team is suited up and back in the game.</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, for the fast-growing companies that need to scale up fast without any loss in quality of their products or services, the IT staff augmentation companies offer thousands of reliable dedicated developers that can easily help your team extend its skills in the shortest period, regardless of their actual place of residence and work.</p>
<h3>#5 When to Use Staff Augmentation?</h3>
<p>Having uncovered why to use this approach, it’s time to find out the major use cases of staff augmentation in detail. You’ll make the most of implementing this method when facing the following list of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If your company needs to scale quickly and requires more IT engineering capabilities to grow your workforce.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If the in-house team lacks specific skills in innovative technologies such as, for instance, Big Data, IoT, Machine Learning, AI, and many more.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If you need to delegate the product development and focus on project management and control.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If your company targets accessing the most experienced and well-trained tech talents all over the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are only a few major reasons for when companies start employing the augmentation model but are sure that each of those has dramatically impacted the business performance and its further development.</p>
<h3>#6 What Are the Benefits of IT Staff Augmentation?</h3>
<p>According to Deloitte, the cost of one bad hire is nearly 2 months of time and more than $4,000. The benefits of staff augmentation, however, can help companies to avoid these outcomes, as they include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">No infrastructure investment – all the workers are ready to contribute from day one</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Eliminated time and spendings on the recruitment process, which is completely handled by the IT staff augmentation companies</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Not bound by any geographical limitations, so the companies can easily choose the best global talents</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Well-organized onboarding with high retention rates</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Advanced control over the product development, the ability to delegate its actual creation to the augmented staff</li>
</ul>
<h3>#7 What Are the Disadvantages &amp; Risks of IT Staff Augmentation?</h3>
<p>Along with the basic advantages, it’s important to learn the possible pitfalls and risks of this model. Of course, the staff is not a cure-all, and might not meet the company&#8217;s expectations completely.</p>
<p>First of all, it’s a long-term undertaking, so the search for certain professionals or specialists with the skills required is not a moment’s work. However, the resources spent are still smaller if compared to hiring a full-time employee joining the existing team in-house.</p>
<p>Also, you might still spend some time bringing the new employees into the loop, but if planned accurately, it’s more than possible to eliminate the onboarding time and organize the process effectively.</p>
<p>Another critical aspect to mind is to determine and resolve the internal issues that might slow down the entire process in time.</p>
<p>With these points considered, it’s more than possible to organize an effective staff augmentation process for your company or enterprise.</p>

<h3>#8 What Is the Difference Between Staff Augmentation vs Managed Services vs Outsourcing</h3>
<p>Recently, we’ve already talked about the differences between <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/staff-augmentation-vs-outsourcing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staff augmentation and outsourcing</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/staff-augmentation-vs-managed-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared employee augmentation to managed services</a>.</p>
<p>Here, we’ll briefly introduce the major features of each.</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Outsourcing – a more broad range of models that includes onshoring, nearshoring, and offshoring, as well as staff augmentation, approaches to engage specialists for performing a certain project within a client’s company.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Staff Augmentation – is one of the outsourcing approaches that mostly relates to hiring employees to cooperate with the existing in-house team.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Managed Services – the approach when not the employees, but the IT services they provide are outsourced. These include data backup, system management, cloud transformation, data warehouse, data storage, network security, and many more.</li>
</ol>
<h3>#9 How to Choose a Reliable IT Staff Augmentation Partner?</h3>
<p>To get the best staff augmentation vendor in IT, it’s essential to check the recommendations from other companies, as well as search for reviews on reputable sites like Clutch or Good Firms. Additionally, make sure the vendor features enough expertise within this field and provides the exact services your company needs.</p>
<p>You can also start the research by reading the company’s portfolio and case studies, and read some reviews to understand who’s providing the first-class services at the most beneficial price.</p>
<p>A great advantage will be when getting in touch and consulting with the vendor, as there you can discuss the rates, hiring speed and procedure, deadlines, and many more.</p>
<h3>#10 What Are the Reasons to Choose Ukraine?</h3>
<p>Ukraine features an extensive talent pool with more than 200,000 developers, with nearly 39,000 IT students graduating each year. Ukrainian developers feature high English proficiency, have advanced skills in the most popular programming languages, such as Java, JS, .NET, Python, PHP, and others.</p>
<p>So far, Ukraine has a highly-developed IT sector with over 4,000 tech companies, ready to deliver innovative projects within a diverse number of different industries, which in combination with the comparatively low rates makes it one of the best talent pools for hire.</p>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>To sum up, IT staff augmentation is one of the most profitable yet effective solutions to quickly replenish your in-house team with well-trained, experienced developers and enhance your company’s performance as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25218 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/FAQ-About-IT-Staff-Augmentation-Development.jpg" alt="FAQ About IT Staff Augmentation Development" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/FAQ-About-IT-Staff-Augmentation-Development.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/FAQ-About-IT-Staff-Augmentation-Development-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/FAQ-About-IT-Staff-Augmentation-Development-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/FAQ-About-IT-Staff-Augmentation-Development-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Unlike the traditional <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software development service</a> outsourcing, this approach enables hiring professional staff that won’t say goodbye once their work is done. Instead, the staff augmentation model empowers companies with powerful in-house developer teams that can significantly save your budget and time while delivering first-class IT products or services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the end of 2021, the worldwide market value of IT services the companies delegate to the IT outsourcing vendors is expected to reach over $413.72 billion, <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/963932/it-outsourcing-services-revenue-in-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Statista</a>. And, the IT outsourcing trend will only increase in the upcoming years, with an annual increase of about 5% each year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24879 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team.jpg" alt="IT Outsourcing Failures Team" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-450x253.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Another thing companies should consider is a huge tech talent shortage trend that has been fueling the tech industry in recent years. Basically, these are the core factors that enhanced outsourcing the IT services and dedicated developers by various tech companies and IT organizations.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll talk about the common problems of outsourcing, its main failures, and the most effective practices of how they can be avoided.</p>
<p>It’s time to start!</p>
<h2>Why Outsourcing Fails?</h2>
<p>Along with implementing the evolving technologies, it becomes more challenging for the companies to develop the whole spectrum of innovative software solutions directly in-house. That is why companies try to build an effective strategy of hiring a dedicated team of developers using the outsourcing approach.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, it’s not that easy as it seems: according to Deloitte, “<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-how-much-disruption.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsourcing as a concept</a> is changing from making it run to making the change happen”.</p></blockquote>
<p>This means you have not only to implement this system but also get the benefits of its performance, as well as successfully resolve the possible issues you will encounter in the process. For instance, the most frequent problems of outsourcing can include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">insufficient communication between the organization and outsourcing vendors</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">the lack of trust with the outsourcing providers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">low expertise in optimizations and improvements</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">inadequate risk evaluation and wrong development strategy</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">the irresponsibility of outsourced staff</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>In fact, these are only a few issues that can result in multiple outsourcing failures of any organization. However, if you still think these are only the minor problems of outsourcing that can’t impact the overall situation, the following <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2020/08/02/vanguard--infosys-are-now-billion-dollar-outsourcing-partners-good-bad--risky/?sh=36dbb8c52672" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistics from Forbes</a> may change your mind: up to 25% of all outsourcing corporations fall within 2 years, and around 50% can fail within 5 years of relationships.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, let’s look closer at the potential IT outsourcing failures your company should be aware of to succeed.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-24878 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-Success.jpg" alt="IT Outsourcing Failures Team Success" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-Success.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-Success-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-Success-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Team-Success-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h2>
<h2>Common IT Outsourcing Failures Your Company Might Encounter</h2>
<p>After we know why outsourcing fails, it’s time to analyze the potential issues you might face when implementing the outsourcing model into your business. As a part of our discussion, you’ll also learn more from the outsourcing failures examples of the world’s largest companies!</p>
<h3>#1 Neglecting the Needs of Your Target Audience</h3>
<p>Modern software development is all about delivering the best tech solutions that fully surpass consumer expectations. That is why any sort of product should be customer-centric and provide the most relevant features that resolve specific problems of your target audience. Otherwise, you’re at risk of failing to recoup the financial investments.</p>
<p>One of these outsourcing examples was Subbxi &#8211; a tool for generating the subtitles, that has not been published on AppStore after its release. The problem was that the client hasn’t done the research to ensure the app will find its audience.</p>
<p>How to avoid this failure: This IT outsourcing failure can be avoided if the customer-centric basics are strongly baked into the project, always targeted during the planning processes, and clearly outlined in the documentation.</p>
<p>This way you can not only improve the quality and performance of your IT product but also clear out what you expect to get with your product, and why these are important.</p>
<h3>#2 Insufficient Communication</h3>
<p>The next thing to consider is establishing the communication channels you’ll use to reach the IT outsourcing providers. In fact, the lack of communication can significantly impact the quality of the final software product and cause a list of issues that need additional inputs, which consequently lead to additional expenses on the IT services.</p>
<p>That is why it’s not enough to only implement outsourcing services to your business. More critical is to always track the progress and timely initiate the changes in the process of developing.</p>
<p>How to avoid this failure: To prevent this outsourcing failure, <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/blog-remote-development-team-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">define the communication channels</a> and the frequency of the QA sessions in advance, and also employ the person in charge of the project’s development. The project lead should be the exact mediator between your company and the outsourcing team and be ready to resolve all the issues.</p>
<h3>#3 Lack of Clarity</h3>
<p>One of the most popular IT outsourcing failures to avoid is the lack of clarity when planning the project and its actual development.</p>
<p>Remember, the outsourcing team will focus on the project documentation when creating the tech product. And, if the outline doesn’t have the clear requirements and instructions of what you expect in the result, you’re likely to get the product that needs further improvements.</p>
<p>How to avoid this failure: To prevent project delays and overpaying for the additional work of your IT outsourcing team, it’s better to state out the clear requirements, goals, and features your product should include. This trick can minimize possible errors and improve the process of software development.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24875 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Employees.jpg" alt="IT Outsourcing Failures Employees" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Employees.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Employees-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Employees-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Employees-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>#4 Poor Planning</h3>
<p>Another common issue of outsourcing failures you might encounter is insufficient planning &#8211; a more global problem if compared with lack of clarity. Poor planning can impact not only the projects your developers are entrusted to create but also the entire process of coworking with your outsourced team.</p>
<p>How to avoid this failure: The detailed analysis of the outsourcing examples has shown that considering the detailed performance of your IT outsourcing team at each stage of the product development is one of the core things to succeed.</p>
<p>For instance, you can start by clearing out the time frames, who and how the progress will be evaluated, as well as the various workflow organization aspects like developing tools, specific requirements, and approaches that are to be used in the process.</p>
<h3>#5 Low Quality of Tech Expertise and Inadequate Outsourcing Price</h3>
<p>Before the start of any project, it’s essential to find out more about the expertise of <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/outsourcing-software-development-to-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your offshore development team</a>. If neglected, this can result in the waste of your time, efforts, and resources needed to get this staff onboarded and when you’ve finally understood that’s not the vendor you want to work with, you need to start all this process all over again.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what happened with the MarketingHelpNet company, which hired an offshore web designer who didn’t possess the required web design skills for creating the functional product, and as a result, the project failed.</p>
<p>How to avoid this failure: Before contracting the vendors, it’s essential to check the references and technical instructions your developers are going to work with. Additionally, to ensure you’ll choose the experienced tech talents for your project, it’s important to research the vendors at a reasonable price and research the case studies before signing the contract.</p>
<h2>Guide to Hiring the Best Tech Talents</h2>
<p>Having analyzed the major outsourcing failures, let’s now briefly summarize how to find the best talents in the tech industry:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Build an MVP first to estimate the project value</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Compare different providers, the services they offer, and their prices</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Provide a clear understanding of your product from top to bottom</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Pay attention to the project planning and processes organization</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Set up the realistic deadlines</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Build reliable communication and stay in touch with your developers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Focus on value over cost, since it may impact the final product performance</li>
</ul>
<p>With having all these points considered, you’ll certainly succeed in hiring the best IT outsourcing vendors for your business.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-24873 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Code.jpg" alt="IT Outsourcing Failures Code" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Code.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Code-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Code-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IT-Outsourcing-Failures-Code-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h2>

<p>In this article, we will uncover why IT outsourcing in Ukraine is so beneficial to businesses, what scopes the Ukraine developers are best for and how to find a reliable outsourcing vendor and hire the best software developers in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Let’s get it started!</p>
<h2>The Emerging Popularity of Ukrainian Outsourcing: International Rankings</h2>

<p>These are only a few software development outsourcing Ukraine statistics that justify the tremendous popularity of its professional specialists on the global IT market.</p>
<h2>Main Services to Consider for Outsourcing Software Development in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Before we’ll dive into the pricing of outsourcing software development in Ukraine, it’s critical to investigate whether or not its developers can fully correspond to all the needs of your company, organization, or business.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it’s no use hiring developers that are experienced in creating the software for the hospitality industry for your eCommerce business. Furthermore, bad hires like choosing the wrong software vendors can result not only in time or progress loss but also can cost millions of dollars for contracting authority!</p>
<p>So, what basic projects can Ukraine developers be hired for?</p>
<h3>Custom Software Development</h3>
<p>First of all, the strong side of IT outsourcing in Ukraine is developing powerful software solutions for nearly any business from any industry. Do you need the proof? Then, you might check out the famous startups like Petcube, Grammarly, DepositPhotos, and more &#8211; originally created in Ukraine, these software solutions are now widely known all over the world.</p>
<p>Whatever project you’re planning to launch, with Ukrainian software developers you’ll surely get the stablest, feature-rich yet effective applications you’ve paid for.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24799 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Teamwork.jpg" alt="Outsourcing Software Development to Ukraine Teamwork" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Teamwork.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Teamwork-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Teamwork-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Teamwork-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Internet of Things</h3>
<p>Any type of IoT device always implies the usage of personal data, which traditionally needs comprehensive protection to minimize the possible threats. Unlike the other outsourcing vendors, Ukraine developers are more competitive in the global outsourcing market because of their extensive experience in working with the personal data of EU, UK, and North American citizens.</p>
<p>Along with governmental personal data regulations of Ukraine (ISO), each company tracks the regulations of the client’s country, ranging from GDPR (EU), PIPEDA (Canada), and HIPAA (USA). At the same time, clients can also initiate the additional data protection requirements: how it’s collected, stored, accessed, and transferred.</p>
<p>One of the well-known IoT projects of Ukraine developers is Ajax System, an IoT security ecosystem that provides wireless security equipment for private and business use.</p>
<h3>AI Technology</h3>
<p>In 2020, Ukraine has become one of the leading countries by the number of Artificial Intelligence providers in Europe. <a href="https://clutch.co/ua/developers/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Clutch</a>, at present, there are over 150 organizations targeted on Artificial Intelligence development, which precedes the number of AI companies in most technologically advanced EU countries like Poland, Estonia, Belarus, Germany, and more.</p>
<p>So far, there are over 30,000 software developers in Ukraine specializing in AI &amp; ML development. The Ukrainian software developers have a strong knowledge of Scala, Hadoop and Python technologies, which are considered to be an integral part of Data Science and Machine Learning.</p>
<h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for good, experienced app developers, outsourcing software developers in Ukraine may be the right option for you. These programmers perform exceptionally well in creating solid, feature-rich yet functional mobile apps according to all the requirements and your business needs.</p>
<p>Besides, these services are delivered at comparatively low prices: with the average hourly rate starting from $20 to $60, the cost of making an app with the basic features starts from $5,000. In contrast, the same in the USA will cost you from $10,000 &#8211; 20,000 and around $18,000 &#8211; 20,000 in Great Britain and Western Europe.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ukrainian software developers feature the best ratio of quality and price, provide flexibility in communication and cooperation, and offer innovative solutions that exactly fit your business needs and goals.</p>
<h3>Blockchain</h3>
<p>At present, blockchain is a comparatively new and innovative technology that requires building solid and functional solutions and is now used in a wide range of fields: financial industry, supply chains, government, healthcare, retail, and more.</p>
<p>However, if choosing a non-experienced vendor for the project in any scope, companies can fail in blockchain technology implementation and get a serious loss of the investments and even the critical data as well.</p>
<p>Hiring blockchain software developers in Ukraine can enhance the security of any type of data, as they have:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">the in-depth knowledge of the major blockchain services</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">vast experiences in working with different platforms, such as Bitcoin, Etherum, HyperLedger Fabric (for private corporate networks), and EOS (introduced by Smart Contracts)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">blockchain development language skills, including Go, Rust, Python, C++, and Solidity</li>
</ul>
<p>With this technology implemented, your business will get more transparency and enhanced traceability for your data, reduce costs and eliminate transaction speed.</p>

<h2>Rates for Outsourcing Software Development in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Being one of the leading IT outsourcing centers in Eastern Europe, hiring Ukrainian software developers can be <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/best-it-outsourcing-strategies-pros-and-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a winning strategy</a> for a variety of businesses from different industry scopes. The most popular industries they are involved in include insurance, healthcare, hospitality, finance, eCommerce, construction, and more.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another great plus of the Ukraine developer is the solid software knowledge, fluent English proficiency, and reasonable price for the IT services. For instance, the average offshore development rates for this region range from $30 to $60 per hour.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the overall software development outsourcing Ukraine rates may vary according to the work experience of a certain candidate:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hourly rate for Junior Software Engineer: $19 &#8211; $25</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hourly rate for Middle Software Engineer: $26 &#8211; $38</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hourly rate for Senior Software Engineer: $39 &#8211; $60</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the rates of countries based in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, you’ll get top-of-the-line innovative software solutions at an affordable price.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ukraine is a home country for over 200,000 professionals, and their number increases with more than 36,000 graduates within this scope annually. These factors make it one of the most attractive options for starting outsourcing software development in Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Main Reasons to Hire Ukrainian Software Developers</h2>
<p>After you know the overall information about IT outsourcing in Ukraine, let’s now discuss why you should consider hiring Ukrainian developers.</p>
<h3>#1 Largest IT outsourcing Market in CEE</h3>
<p>Ukraine is the 2nd largest tech hub in Central Eastern Europe, with over 200,000 programmers located in the 5 biggest cities: Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Odessa. Furthermore, compared to Poland, it offers more attractive outsourcing rates at the same or even higher quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, it takes 11th position in the rating of top software development outsourcing countries in the world. According to recent research, over 90% of IT services in Ukraine are outsourced, while the remaining 10% develop their own programming products.</p>
<h3>#2 Solid Educational Background of Developers</h3>
<p>There are around 450 technical universities and colleges with advanced programming courses, and over 36,000 new graduates annually enroll in the IT market. Most of them start practicing their programming skills after the 2nd or 3rd course of their bachelor’s degree, which makes it even more beneficial to be hired after graduation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, nearly all the Ukrainian developers can fluently speak English at the Intermediate (more than 37%), Upper-intermediate (over 35%), or even Advanced levels (around 13%).</p>
<p>This ensures smooth communication yet more productive cooperation between the certain organization and outsourced team of Ukrainian software developers.</p>
<p>These are only a few qualities that significantly stimulate the demand for outsourcing talented Ukrainian developers.</p>
<h3>#3 Plenty of IT Service Outsourcing Companies</h3>
<p>Most IT outsourcing companies in Ukraine offer Flexible cooperation models within only 1-2 hours away from most European countries. At present, there are over 1,600 companies that provide the core web technologies for software development, including JavaScript, Java, C#, Python, PHP, C++, TypeScript, and more.</p>
<p>Most of these tech companies are founded by entrepreneurs with a global mindset, such organizations are mostly focused on delivering the best results to their contractors and facilitating their success as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24796 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Process.jpg" alt="Outsourcing Software Development to Ukraine Process" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Process-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Process-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Process-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>#4 Impressive Value/Cost Rates</h3>
<p>By offering the most beneficial yet attractive prices for the services, Ukraine has already become one of the best IT outsourcing hubs in Europe. It features lower average rates for the services provided and has much more programming specialists within any industry. So, it’s more than possible to hire:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Junior-level programmer for $570 for 1 month</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Middle-level Ukraine developer for $1800 per month</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Senior-level specialist for around $3000 for one month of work</li>
</ul>
<p>And, we can reassure you, the software products developed have not only the same quality as those created in other CEE countries. Ofter, Ukrainian software developers provide even better technological solutions for specific cases than can be offered in most international leading IT hubs!</p>
<h3>#5 Convenient Location and Time Zone</h3>
<p>The geographic proximity makes Ukraine one of the most attractive locations for both nearshoring and offshoring. Placed in just 2-3 hours of flight time from most of the European countries, it allows sharing 7 of 9 business hours with the majority of them.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are always direct flights from Ukraine to the most popular European tech hubs including Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and more. And, the flight ticket can be purchased for as little as $15 &#8211; 19.</p>
<h3>#6 More Working Hours Per Week</h3>
<p>An average full-time developer works around 33 hours per week, in the UK these numbers can barely reach 36 hours, which is not too far from the US workers (37.5 hours per week).</p>
<p>In Ukraine, the majority of developers in tech-related outsourcing companies spend between 40 to 60 hours at work per week. Furthermore, your company can benefit from the public holidays too: there are only 11 paid public holidays in Ukraine, which is 2-7 days less compared to most EU countries.</p>
<p>Of course, that might not be too notable at first, but such a slight working hour difference can enhance up to several months in certain cases of project completion.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24798 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Team.jpg" alt="Outsourcing Software Development to Ukraine Team" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Team.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Team-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Team-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Team-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>How to Find the Reliable Outsourcing Vendor in Ukraine</h2>
<p>For sure, when it comes to IT outsourcing, Ukrainian software developers are <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/why-do-companies-outsource/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most beneficial options to choose</a>. At the same time, it’s still critical to learn the most important aspects to consider when choosing the software developing company for hire.</p>
<p>This can prevent the loss of time, efforts, and investments for your organization, and ensures you won’t need to start the outsourcing organization research from scratch.</p>
<p>So, what are the core things to pay attention to when choosing the right IT outsourcing vendor in Ukraine?</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Uncover the local IT industry landscape and the top vendors you can hire Ukraine developers from</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Ask for the portfolio and existing case studies of your potential candidate, explore the major scopes/industries and companies the IT company cooperated earlier with. Remember, you should look not for the company that features the best technological solutions, you should find the one that can provide the exact software products your business or company needs</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Analyze the awards, certificates, and compliances to define whether or not this software vendor can be trusted. As a rule, the outsourcing companies have certifications from the leading tech providers within the same scope (if you’re looking for cloud solutions development, you should probably look for AWS or Google Cloud partnership). Other great certifications to look for are ISO 27001:2013, ISO 9001:2015, PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, and more.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Define the strong sides of your potential IT outsourcing vendor and why it’s better than other competitors. You should also pay attention to the price/value rate to avoid low-quality outcomes. Additionally, browse the official website, corporate blogs, and social media of the outsourcing company to get a more concrete idea of what types of projects they have already done and what was the quality of their final results.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Contact the software vendor and estimate whether or not they’re open for communication. For instance, the modern outsourcing companies in Ukraine like Intellecsoft invite for an expert consultation regarding the project or problem you have to get the overall idea about it and whether or not they can help you with the exact services you need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, that’s only a general list of what should be checked when choosing the best IT outsourcing vendors in Ukraine. Nevertheless, with having all <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/collaboration-with-an-outsourcing-vendor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these aspects</a> checked, you can be more than certain about getting the best software solutions for your business.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To sum up, onboarding software developers in Ukraine is one of the most beneficial ways for companies and businesses to obtain innovative technological solutions and approaches at a reasonable price.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24793 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Developer.jpg" alt="Outsourcing Software Development to Ukraine Developer" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Developer.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Developer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Developer-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Developer-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given the circumstances of today’s working conditions, we can assume that remote work isn’t going anywhere any time soon. Thus, we need to determine whether outsourcing is limited to the realm of remote development or if product management can be outsourced as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24527 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Process" width="640" height="420" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process-600x394.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process-450x295.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Before, we were confident that it was possible to outsource everything except the product team. But after a time we began to wonder, why can’t product teams be remote too?</p>
<p>This article will discuss whether remote product management and development are realistic and consider both the pros and cons of each.</p>
<h2>Common Reasons for Outsourcing</h2>
<p>Every month at Intellectsoft, we speak with dozens of companies that are considering remote development. Most often, they fall into one of several categories:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Small to medium businesses that digitize a business model </b><b>with proven offline results</b>. In this case, the company has a working knowledge of how an online business should work. They simply bring existing business processes online.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Companies that scale up existing business processes.</b> This case includes all those who have built successful MVPs but are now thinking about scaling their success by adding more functionality to reach a larger audience.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Companies that are working on a one-time addition to existing functionality. </b>In such cases, it makes no sense to hire someone from the outside due to the irregular nature of the development work.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Businesses that plan to develop a solution from scratch.</b> Usually, these include companies that need a specific business solution and then long-term support. They do not intend to periodically change the product, conduct dozens of AB tests, and so on. Just building, deploying, and using is their purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recently, due to COVID-19, more and more companies are doing what was previously considered impossible. They are transitioning product and marketing development to remote.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-24529 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Manager" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h2>
<h2>Why Product Management Is Moving to Remote</h2>
<p>Both well-developed businesses and young startups have been resorting to outsourcing for product management. Some of the most common reasons for this include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lack of qualified human resources.</b> Often, teams don&#8217;t have enough in-house resources to test new products or research a new segment of users and do it right. This is where remote teams come in handy.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>They need new products or features urgently, and deadlines are on fire. </b>Imagine you’re a face mask production and the pandemic strikes. Now you want to quickly scale production and customer acquisition channels but don&#8217;t have enough workforce to do so. That’s when you don’t have time to hire and onboard new staff and need someone who can ship things right away.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Need solid product expertise for good money. </b>A company has no experience working with developers and product managers. They cannot spend a year and a half on acquiring expertise, hiring personnel, and developing it. In this case, it is better to turn to those who have sufficient expertise.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The current team is failing and product development needs to be accelerated. </b>If a company is willing to try a product-led growth model, the product manager has to be a seasoned professional. The current team may not be the best fit for the product-led growth philosophy or meet the new requirements for development speed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Critical Role of the Product Manager</h2>
<p>The position of a product manager has only been around for a short time. There are plenty of definitions of what a PM is. But for all of them, there is one that we can stick to. The product manager is the person responsible for creating and bringing a new product to market.</p>
<p>Suppose you look through hundreds of PM vacancies and conduct an in-depth analysis. Soon, it becomes clear that a product manager is a specialist who works at the intersection of business, marketing, and programming.</p>
<p>At every stage, they control the work on a new product, interact with investors and users, and develop their brainchild after the technical implementation.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the main task is to develop new products in line with trends and the needs of users. Beyond this, there are plenty of other responsibilities and fields of expertise for a PM:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Collecting information</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Deriving product requirements</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Creating a work plan and distributing roles among staff</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Promoting and selling the product</li>
</ul>
<p>Product manager&#8217;s top skills:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">market research and market analysis to determine the basic needs of customers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">implementation of product lines and testing new ideas</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">conducting competitive analysis, comparing similar products through numerous characteristics</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">development of marketing communications</li>

</ul>
<p>This is a crucial role for any project. So why would a big company&#8217;s CEO outsource a product manager or an entire product team?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24528 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Discussion" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>Reasons for Outsourcing the Product Manager and Product Team</h2>
<p>Well, there are a couple of reasons to do so. First, you get world-class experts working on your product. These professionals usually take jobs for a limited period of time tied directly to KPIs or a set of other mission-critical objectives like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The number of conversions and sign-ups compared to the current performance.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Marginality. The actual sales are compared with the planned figures.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Active users. Evaluate how many people are using the product daily.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Customer Retention Rate (CRR). The retention rate of new users, which in most cases is even more critical than the acquisition.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">ROI. An indicator of the return on income tied to the cost of advertising. It shows whether the investment has paid off or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delivering these KPIs means that the remote project manager and their development team are responsible for more than just releasing new functionality. They are entirely responsible for achieving specific business goals.</p>
<p>Leading product development experts often command high salaries. Thus, hiring them as full-time in-house staff can be incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>Additionally, product design and prototyping equipment can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, not including the costs of maintenance and repair. Outsourced product development is often much less expensive than in-house design.</p>
<p>And in the end, you are not responsible for your outsourced product team. This is very useful if you are testing a product MVP based on market hypotheses. You can quickly terminate cooperation if the test was unsuccessful and the product-market fit was not found. Most outsourced product teams agree on that with their clients in advance.</p>
<h2>What Is the Future of Product Team Outsourcing?</h2>
<p>At Intellectsoft, we see a roughly 25% increase in clients wanting to include product managers and analysts as part of their outsourced teams.</p>
<p>Agile development methodology allows for one product specialist to work on 1-3 projects simultaneously, alternating the planning, prototyping, development, and analysis phases among themselves.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24526 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Office" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The only requirement for organizing a high-performing team of this level is the willingness of stakeholders to adhere to the process and agreed priorities. Remote product teams are capable of quick pivots, but only within extended sprints.</p>
<p>We anticipate that product management and analyst outsourcing will become more mainstream over the next three years in the wake of traditional marketing and development outsourcing.</p>
<p>As skilled specialist shortages and prices grow, availability and affordable prices will become critical factors in attracting these teams to an increasing number of players in the market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to recent research, the global market size of outsourcing services <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1900/it-outsourcing/#dossierContents__outerWrapper">has reached over $92.5 billion</a>, and over 70% of this value falls underhub the category of information technology outsourcing.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24472 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Process.jpg" alt="Communication With Remote Development Team Process" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Process-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Process-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Process-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>And that’s not surprising, as this sphere involves the employment of various IT-service providers, application services, and infrastructure solutions for enhancing the core business processes.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why do companies outsource? Well, the major reasons for this are to reduce and control the hiring costs, enhance the core business processes and improve the company’s focus, boost the KPI and perform more tasks at tight time frames, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, before the business gets the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/saas-development-outsourcing-key-benefits/">outsourcing benefits</a>, it needs to resolve its main challenge — to establish efficient remote team communication.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll uncover the main business challenges of remote teams communication and also the best practices of enhancing team communication while outsourcing software development.</p>
<h2>Collaborating With Remote Software Developers: Main Challenges</h2>
<p>First of all, let’s analyze the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/software-development-outsourcing-risks/">potential challenges</a> and communication issues companies can encounter when hiring a remote development team.</p>
<p>Having covered the majority of these, it becomes much easier to develop an effective yet efficient business strategy to resolve the existing problems and prevent the issues that might occur further.</p>
<h3>Miscommunication Problems</h3>
<p>Communication is one of the core factors that have a huge impact on the employees’ well-being and productivity. According to McKinsey’s recent research, the teams who feel engaged in detailed remote communications are nearly <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/what-employees-are-saying-about-the-future-of-remote-work">5 times more likely to enhance their KPIs</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the post-COVID-19 realities uncovered that only 32% of employees have experienced the great communication set up from their organizations, which means a vast majority of businesses nowadays still have vague remote team communication.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24468 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Chat.jpg" alt="Communication With Remote Development Team Chat" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Chat.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Chat-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Chat-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Chat-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>The miscommunication can not only impact the workflow and employees’ well-being but also result in serious losses for the organizations themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>This means great delays in the project development, as well as spending tons of time, costs, and effort for correcting the issues and troubleshooting.</p>
<h3>Disconnection Issues</h3>
<p>The other huge drawback of the poor remote team communication is that the workers are isolated from the traditional working environment, and need much more time for clarifying the issues and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Not to mention how the lack of connection impacts the remote team management: it becomes harder to build effective communication with remote teams and regularly control their performance as well.</p>
<p>The thing is the team-bonding moments always happen, especially when working at a large organization since you have some off-work interactions like a common lunch or small talk by a water cooler.</p>
<p>The peculiarities of telework only compound the problem: you need to consider the schedule of each member and find the right tools for team-building opportunities.</p>
<h3>Disunion Challenges</h3>
<p>The lack of collaboration is another important issue when onboarding a remote development team. It often occurs because of the absence of teamwork, low motivation, and a minor input into the common cause.</p>
<p>As a result, everyone minds only their own business and avoids sharing important ideas and feedback because of that feeling of undervaluation and also the burnout — common issue team members might feel because of the lack of collaborative work.</p>
<p>In fact, by helping employees understand how their work connects to the goals of the company you can <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/corporate-communications/role/communications-leaders">improve the company’s performance by up to 10%,</a> according to Gartner. That is why, one of the most essential points while developing the business performance is to improve team communication.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24471 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Job.jpg" alt="Communication With Remote Development Team Job" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Job.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Job-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Job-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Job-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Alienation Feeling</h3>
<p>With poor team communication, employees may also feel like a sore thumb because of the lack of live communication and interaction with each other. The stressful feeling caused by the so-called alienation results in increased employee anxiety.</p>
<p>The researches have shown that this issue can greatly decrease working performance, reduce job satisfaction and even lead to resignation. For the global economy poor mental health, caused by insufficient remote team communication, can cost <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/what-employees-are-saying-about-the-future-of-remote-work">up to $1 trillion per year</a>.</p>
<h3>Management Issues</h3>
<p>The last and most significant problem of remote communications for business performance is the remote control issues. For the project managers, it becomes even more challenging to organize and control the working performance of each employee, track their progress and define the most effective strategies for the KPI improvement.</p>
<p>As a result, the team members feel uncertain about their work, and cannot interact comfortably with each other — they just try to avoid talking with anyone, even if that impacts the quality of their work.</p>
<h2>Strategies to Improve Communication with Your Remote Software Development Team</h2>
<p>After you know the main challenges of setting up effective remote team communication, let’s review the ways you can resolve these problems.</p>
<p>Basically, the 3 core factors will matter here: the correct team-building techniques, managers with high leadership skills, and professional software. To lift up the lid for you: the last one turns out to be the most essential for developing the best remote communications.</p>
<h3>Use the Right Team-Building Techniques</h3>
<p>One of the first things to consider when developing remote teams’ communication is to apply the most effective team-building strategies that can emphasize the importance of each member’s input. For example, it’s essential to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Listen to the employee’s feedback or suggestions and encourage them to voice their opinions;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Brainstorm the ideas of how to improve the workflow and increase the employee’s performance;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Set up the small talks and engage the team members in the off-work interactions to prevent burnout;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Organize informal events to encourage better interactions between the team members and managers so no one feels left out.</li>
</ul>
<p>These simple yet effective techniques can be modified or complemented depending on your organization’s goals and needs. However, the application of even one of these strategies can significantly enhance the productivity of your remote employees and improve business performance.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24470 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Employees.jpg" alt="Communication With Remote Development Team Employees" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Employees.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Employees-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Employees-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Employees-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Develop the Leadership Skills of Your Remote Team</h3>
<p>The other method of developing remote communications is hiring a professional manager that features vast experience in remote work optimization.</p>
<p>This person is aware of the most effective team-building tactics and can analyze which of them will provide you with the best performance results and enhance your company’s KPI.</p>
<p>Additionally, the professional manager can guide you in employing the pre-made or creating the fully-customized software for remote communication, a perfect option to establish the production workflow for the telework or outsourcing. Still uncertain about its efficiency? Discover the essential benefits it can bring to your business below!</p>
<h3>Employ the Effective Team Communication Software</h3>
<p>One of the core options that define the success of the remote team interaction improvement is choosing the right communication software. Such software opens up a lot of perspectives for productive remote work, as it:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Allows reaching the team members anytime and from anywhere;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Enables creating multiple working chats (formal and informal) to communicate, share the news and updates, ideas, and suggestions regarding different topics;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Enhances the time-management with the in-built calendar for the task scheduling;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Improves the employee management and control (for instance, by showing the current status — online, offline, at the meeting, etc);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Speeds up the entire working process and improves its quality, so that the projects are always completed in time and are less likely to contain human errors and other issues;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Prevents leakage of business-related data that can happen if personal challenges are used for corporate communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, if some of the features your business needs are not covered by the premade communication software for remote teams, it’s a great idea to launch the custom software solutions.</p>
<p>They will not simply meet all the essential requirements, needs, and business goals, but are also great because of the advanced personalization, painless integration, high security, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>Created by the professional team of developers, such software won’t require the additional costs with licenses or the constant changes, as it can much easier adjust to your business and be used in the long run.</p>
<p>Additionally, the custom communication software can be integrated with other software allowing the remote employees to increase their working performance and productivity as well.</p>
<h2>Why Is Team Communication Important?</h2>
<p>Setting up the right remote development team communication allows your departments to effectively interact with each other, saving tons of effort, costs, and, which is more important &#8211; the time needed for troubleshooting, clarification, optimization, and other pivotal business processes.</p>
<p>For the outsourced remote teams, setting up the is even more critical, as the written communication becomes the main information channel remote team uses to perform various business tasks.</p>
<p>If this outsourcing factor is neglected, the businesses can’t get any benefits from the remote employees at best. At worst, this will lead to an enormous loss of resources, including the time and costs spent on employee onboarding.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24474 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Workflow.jpg" alt="Communication With Remote Development Team Workflow" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Workflow.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Workflow-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Workflow-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Communication-With-Remote-Development-Team-Workflow-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
