										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/web-application-and-api-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner </a>defines the web application market as an environment that is continuously evolving, incorporating new technologies and increasing safety standards.</p>
<p>In this regard, the proper attention to the foundational design of a web app contributes to maintaining the required robustness, responsiveness, and security of this software. In a web app, this is what solid web app architecture is responsible for.</p>
<p>Web application architecture refers to the way in which the various software components of a web application interact with each other and the hardware they run on.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25118 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Web-application-architecture-team.jpg" alt="Web application architecture team" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Web-application-architecture-team.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Web-application-architecture-team-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Web-application-architecture-team-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Web-application-architecture-team-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>This article will provide an overview of modern web application architecture, including its key components, types, and models so that you can invest in this type of architecture with confidence.</p>
<h2>What Is Web Application Architecture?</h2>
<p>The definition of web app architecture is broad and depends on the focus of building web applications. Technically, it’s the skeleton of a web app, including its elements, databases, systems, servers, interfaces, and all the communication happening between them. In more abstract terms, it indicates the logic behind responses to client and server requests.</p>
<p>When it comes to business benefits, web application architecture refers to the process of creating web applications and planning for their needs in terms of speed, scalability, and security.</p>
<p>In short, web app architecture refers to how web applications are structured and how they’re deployed on a server. As opposed to most desktop software, which users download and install, an Internet-based service must operate seamlessly over HTTP.</p>
<h2>Why Is Web App Architecture Important?</h2>
<p><b>Ensure customer satisfaction:</b> Investing in web application architecture, or a solid blueprint of its functioning, is needed from the standpoint of user experience.</p>
<p>Being an important part of developing any web app, it makes sure your design is efficient and scalable, which means it will work well under a variety of conditions and avoid downtime. Otherwise, a business app will irritate users with numerous bugs and turn them away from cooperating with it.</p>
<p><b>Greater business results:</b> The right web application architecture can save your company time and money over the long term, making sure that your website operates at its optimal capacity and runs smoothly without any problems.</p>
<p>In particular, web app architecture allows web developers to create websites that scale well as traffic increases; it also provides features such as offline access (e.g., Google Docs) that are increasingly expected by today’s consumers.</p>
<p><b>Better app performance:</b> A solid web app architecture introduces a great degree of flexibility, meaning its adaptiveness to dynamic market fluctuations and customer demands.</p>
<p>The vision on the overall structure makes it easier for developers to work on an app in several modules and introduce new features without interrupting the web app’s work.</p>
<p><b>Improved app security:</b> By envisioning a web app as the system of several blocks, modern web application architecture protects each of its structural elements separately.</p>
<p>This way, overall security increases, making the software stand all the common safety threats like malicious attacks. Thanks to the solid structure, adding new elements won’t ruin the achieved security level.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25116 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme.jpeg" alt="web app architecture scheme" width="921" height="548" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme.jpeg 921w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme-300x179.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme-768x457.jpeg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme-600x357.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-scheme-450x268.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px" /></p>
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>The exact way how web application architecture operates differs between projects, as many of its aspects aren’t dictated by technology but by your project’s needs and business objectives. In other words, web app elements can be adjusted or changed entirely without affecting the overall success of your web app.</p>
<p>At the same time, the typical process of communicating with web app architecture is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">You as a client type an URL in the relevant browser field.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The browser sends the request to the Domain Name Server to recognize the IP address.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If successful, the browser sends a request to the server to respond.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The server directs the request to the data storage to locate the page, request data display.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If successful, the initially requested data appears in your browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this web application architecture diagram, you can see 3 main sides of the process:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Client-side, or the frontend for user interaction</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Database server, or an extra component for sending client’s data to the server</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Server-side, or the backend storing business logic, processing requests, and sending responses</li>
</ul>
<p>Correspondingly, there exist 3 web application architecture layers:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Presentation layer</b>: The place with static content and dynamic elements that assist interaction between users and browsers. Programming this layer requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as it stands for the app’s frontend.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Data layer (Data Access and Data Service): </b>The Data Access layer is closely linked with the business layer as it gets needed information from the servers. In this environment, there can also be serverless cloud platforms like MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle RDBMS, Redis. In its turn, the Data Service layer separates business logic from the client-side while processing requests.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Business layer</b>: The web app’s backend that determines business logic and responses to browser requests that are sent to the presentation layer. The programming languages include Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby, and the environment contains servers, IaaS, PaaS, or serverless cloud platforms.</li>
</ol>
<p>All the layers work independently and communicate with each other through the relevant components.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25115 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle.png" alt="web app architecture request response cycle" width="1001" height="721" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle.png 1001w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle-300x216.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle-768x553.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle-600x432.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-app-architecture-request-response-cycle-450x324.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" /></p>
<h2>Web Application Architecture Components</h2>
<p>The applications differ in complexity and functionality, and the number of layers and components changes accordingly. It may happen that an app is so simple that it works as a monolith storing all the web app architecture in one place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a typical web app will consist of multiple components (or tiers) that interact with each other. Usually, the two major groups for web application architecture are user interface and structural web components.</p>
<h3>User Interface Components</h3>
<p>This group of components composes a visual interface and has no ties to the architecture itself. Being a part of the interface layout design, the set of UI components includes activity logs, dashboards with analytics, and notifications.</p>
<h3>Structural Web Components</h3>
<p><b>Client components</b>: The frontend part that appears in the browser and serves as the field to interact with a web application. The client components are developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and don’t need an operating system or device connectivity to operate. Simply put, these components are the web app representation.</p>
<p><b>Server components</b>: The backend part of the web application architecture that is built using Java, Python, .Net, NodeJS, PHP, and Ruby on Rails to create app logic. Also, server components compose the database, meaning a control center for data storage.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25119 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram.png" alt="web application deployment diagram" width="809" height="587" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram.png 809w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram-300x218.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram-768x557.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram-600x435.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/web-application-deployment-diagram-450x327.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></p>
<h2>Models of Web Applications</h2>
<p>Web application architecture models differ based on two criteria: the number of servers and the number of databases. To pick the best one, you should carefully revise your aims and constraints and find the most appropriate one for the current stage of business development.</p>
<h3>One Web Server, One Database Model</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The simplest</b>: You have only one server and one database for all the requests and responses.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relatively unreliable</b>: If the single server goes down, your app will shut down immediately.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relevant for testing</b>: These days, one web server, one database model is too old for real apps. However, it’s a great way to test your web app idea and overview the fundamental design of your web app as an MVP.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multiple Web Servers, One Database Model</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Stateless architecture</b>: There is no single web server for data storage. When a client inputs information, the relevant server writes it to the sole database managed outside.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relatively reliable</b>: As there are more than two servers in the model, a backup server is always available.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>One database availability</b>: Dangerous in terms of possible website crash.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multiple Web Servers, Multiple Databases Model</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The most efficient</b>: No single point of failure, as there are several web servers and databases.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility</b>: You have at least two options for database storage, so you can choose to keep identical data in all of them or distribute information.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Some information can be lost</b>: In the case of a crash, you won’t lose your entire web app. Nevertheless, some data will be lost. To prevent this scenario from happening, it’s better to install load balancers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Web Application Architecture</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25114 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-1024x563.png" alt="Progressive Web Apps" width="1024" height="563" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-1024x563.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-300x165.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-768x423.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-1536x845.png 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-2048x1127.png 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-600x330.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-450x248.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Progressive-Web-Apps-1-1000x550.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>A web application architecture type is a particular pattern under which the components interact with each other. In other words, it shows the way app logic lets the client side and server side communicate.</p>
<p>To make the right choice here, it’s also relevant to check your business requirements, along with technical information about features, functionalities, and the desired app logic.</p>
<h3>Single Page Application Architecture</h3>
<p>This web application architecture is designed to show relevant content only. To make this happen, it first loads the relevant web page and then dynamically updates the representation of its content with the requested information only.</p>
<p>In other words, it doesn’t refer to the server for loading new pages but sends requests for the needed parts of the webpage only.</p>
<p>Single Page Applications contribute to smoother performance and a more intuitive user experience.</p>
<h3>Microservice Architecture</h3>
<p>Being the frequent alternative to an unreliable monolithic web application architecture, microservices disperse the functionality to deliver small and lightweight services separately.</p>
<p>In particular, they are loosely coupled and use APIs for communication if a sophisticated business problem arises. This peculiarity eases the developer’s life since it’s possible for individual service components to be built in different programming languages.</p>
<p>Thanks to its flexibility and stability, microservice architecture has gained popularity these days, with businesses like Amazon, eBay, and Netflix adopting it for their complex needs.</p>
<h3>Serverless Architecture</h3>
<p>In this web application architecture type, you outsource both server and infrastructure management to a third-party cloud service provider. This way, a web app logic execution won’t intervene in the infrastructure running.</p>
<p>Choosing a serverless architecture is good for companies that want to delegate server and hardware management to a reliable tech partner and concentrate on front-end development tasks instead.</p>
<p>Also, this web application architecture type allows working on small functions in apps. The service providers that assist in server management are Amazon and Microsoft, among others.</p>
<h3>Progressive Web Apps</h3>
<p>Being among the most promising web app trends <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/us/en/blog-list/2019/doubling-down-on-our-progressive-web-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2019</a>, progressive web apps offer a convenient and effective user experience available from any browser and device through a shared URL.</p>
<p>The application of progressive web apps is wide, including industries like entertainment, finance, and <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/progressive-web-apps-for-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eCommerce</a>. Their key benefits include lightweight, cost-effectiveness, cross-device nature, ability to attract web traffic, and a fully functioning app experience.</p>
<h2>Web Application Architecture: Best Practices and Tips</h2>
<p>Here, we’ve gathered the top 5 recommendations for business owners to consider while working on web app architecture for their projects and building cooperation with tech partners.</p>
<h3>1. Think of a proper web application architecture at the earliest stages</h3>
<p>Without a comprehensive structure, your application will turn into a labyrinth of messy elements and components that are too hard to handle.</p>
<h3>2. Don’t copy somebody’s success</h3>
<p>The top mistake is to pick a web application architecture of a successful company and simply replicate it. In reality, a successful architecture is one that corresponds with your business goals and ideas, not theirs.</p>
<h3>3. Pay attention to your technical limitations</h3>
<p>It’s not always possible to get the best and most successful elements in your web application architecture. However, with the proper attention to quality attributes and realistic business expectations, you will get the maximum from all the components you have.</p>
<h3>4. Eliminate the problems right away</h3>
<p>Don’t wait for the web app release to fix the problems in its architecture. The earlier you address the issues, the more reliable core features it will have.</p>
<h3>5. Create a checklist of successful web app features</h3>
<p>To make sure your web app has achieved its goal, it’s good practice to note your expectations from it at the very beginning and discuss their possibility and measurable KPIs with your tech partner.</p>
<p>The possible checklist may include these features:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Overall system flexibility</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Components can be reused</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Well-written code</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Ability to scale</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">System stability</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Easy bug detection</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Sticking to security standards</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Fields to work with user feedback</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">No crashes</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Easy-to-use</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Responds fast</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Can be deployed automatically</li>
</ul>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/best-android-frameworks/">10 Best Framework for Android App Development in 2022</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog">Intellectsoft Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, society lives a completely app-dependent life: our daily routines, working, or studying habits completely depend on tons of different applications installed on our Android or iOS device.</p>
<p>We read the Gmail app notifications, order food delivery on UberEats, chat with colleagues on Teams or Slack, and follow the people we like on Instagram.</p>
<p>All these things became available with the frameworks &#8211; the multicomponent tools that enable developing plenty of applications for mobile use.</p>
<blockquote><p>By 2026, the global mobile app market size is expected to <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/mobile-application-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach $407.31 billion at a CAGR of 18.4%,</a> which is mostly caused by the rising number of Android and iOS smartphone users and the new technologies and services delivered to the app market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Intellectsoft’s best experts will introduce the essential insights to know about the application frameworks and how they’re used for creating different app projects.</p>
<p>As a part of our discussion, you’ll uncover the top 10 most popular tools for Android framework development, the features they offer as well as the projects they’ll best fit too. This knowledge will help you to figure out which of the Android frameworks will work perfectly for your upcoming projects.</p>
<p>Let’s get this started!</p>
<h2>What is an Application Framework?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25111 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash.jpg" alt="developer" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>As you might have already figured out, an application framework is a specific tool that provides pre-made templates, components, and structure for application development. It is mainly focused on building various types of application’s architecture, including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Native applications (the OS-specific apps for iOS, Android, etc)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hybrid applications (multi-platform apps, usually written on JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Web applications (accessible through a web browser).</li>
</ul>
<p>Android framework features a component structure and customizable interface, provides the possibility to reuse the app design and code, and centralize the base code under one location. With all these features stated, we can summarize that the core idea of the Android framework is to help programmers create the app structure and write the code much faster.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to Statcounter’s statistics, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 70%</a> of the overall market share of mobile operating systems refers to Android OS.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>By the end of 2021, the IT spending on enterprise software is expected to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/203428/total-enterprise-software-revenue-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach over $600 billion worldwide</a>, with a CAGR of 13.6% compared to 2020. As a substantial amount of these costs are invested in the software development branch, developers are now looking for the most optimized and effective methods of software creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Different types of software development methodologies can significantly eliminate the time, resources, and costs needed for the project realization. However, due to the vast number of these methodologies currently existing, it becomes more and more challenging to pick up the best model for each specific case.</p>
<p>In this article, Intellectsoft’s best experts will analyze all the available different software development methodologies within the industry, as well as define their strong sides and possible drawbacks so you could come up with the most beneficial yet efficient approach that ideally fits your project.</p>
<p>Let’s get it started!</p>
<h2>What Is a Software Development Methodology?</h2>
<p>To understand the types of development models existing, it’s important to learn the project development basics first.</p>
<p>The software development methodology refers to the development SDLC (software development life cycle) model, which is focused on organizing beneficial yet effective project development processes from the idea and planning to front-back &amp; back-end development, testing, and software launching.</p>
<p>In other words, it is a so-called app development lifecycle that applies different formats, approaches, and techniques and helps to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Effectively organize the workflow</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Eliminate time for the project development</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Reduce the costs needed to develop a software</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Track the process of creation</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Provide a set of norms for the effective communication</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Improve the quality of the final product and more</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, there are 12 standalone types of software development methodologies that introduce different models of project creating. However, each of those has its unique advantages and possible drawbacks, so it’s essential to analyze the core gist of your project as well as learn the pick up the most effective</p>
<p>As for 2021, one of the leading technological approaches practiced for software development is DevOps methodology, which is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1233917/software-development-methodologies-practiced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used in every third project (35.9%),</a> says Statista.</p>
<p>But, in practice, it’s more efficient to review all the options available on the market and define which of the software development methodologies can fit your program best.</p>
<h2>Types of Software Development Methodologies</h2>
<p>As you already know, there are various types of different software development methodologies aimed at improving SDLC.</p>
<p>However, having reviewed them you can find out there’s no one outright winner – for each specific case, the strategy will be different based on the project’s characteristics, requirements, main goals, core features, and more.</p>
<p>Thus, the detailed comparison of software development methodologies can simplify the choice and help you to define the most winning option for each app development project individually.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Possible Drawbacks</h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The planning stage can be too challenging to organize the entire process</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Low flexibility and inability to implement the changes once the software development process is started</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The immediate changes to the project can result in additional spendings that are usually enormously high</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A longer time of delivery</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Weak for long or ongoing projects</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Deciding between native and cross-platform development is always a challenge. Read this guide to make this choice confidently!</i></p>
<p>In 2017, we at Intellectsoft had a customer who asked to make an MVP (“minimum variable product”) on Flutter, a commercial cross-platform app development kit from Google.</p>
<p>The decision to invest in MVP is a common stage in software development, serving as a proof-of-concept and an early app version with the main features included. Our task was to create an MVP to show off to competitors, not accelerate the development process or cut expenses.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24885 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Native-vs-Cross-Platform-App-Development-Process.jpg" alt="Native vs Cross Platform App Development Process" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Native-vs-Cross-Platform-App-Development-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Native-vs-Cross-Platform-App-Development-Process-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Native-vs-Cross-Platform-App-Development-Process-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Native-vs-Cross-Platform-App-Development-Process-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Flutter was new to the market, so the app development experienced inevitable challenges. In conversations with the client, we mentioned the rawness of the development language, problems with possible scaling, and lack of tech talents acquainted with this development platform. But the customer still wanted to try.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all the predicted challenges came to light. The project was hard to scale and lacked the required resources due to low business priority.</p>
<p>For Intellectsoft, the takeaway from this case is straightforward: technology is not an end in itself. The well-built development strategy brings business benefits. And so, the choice between native and cross-platform tools depends on your business aims too.</p>
<h2>5 Main Differences of Native vs. Cross-Platform App Development</h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Responsiveness</b>. Since native code accesses the device’s internal resources directly, native apps generally demonstrate better performance.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Value-for-money</b>. Cross-platform apps are made faster and cheaper.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>App stability</b>. In a long run, native apps demonstrate more stability and work well for long-term projects.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>UI/UX design</b>. Generally, native apps are more attractive and effective in terms of user interface and user experience.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Safety</b>. Native app development deals with encrypted and obfuscated infrastructure, while cross-platform apps need extra measures to ensure security.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What Is Native App Development?</h2>
<p>This type of app development deals with the platform’s native language and native APIs/frameworks to link to internal functions, meaning Java or Kotlin (with its JDK) for Android and Obj-C or Swift (on its SDK) for iOS.</p>
<p>Thanks to these specifics, native apps provide a better user experience, demonstrate higher performance, and can be personalized. Moreover, access to the devices’ features allows building complex yet stable and secure functionalities.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24884 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Native-vs-Cross-Platform-App-Development-Mobile.jpg" alt="Native vs Cross Platform App Development Mobile" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Native-vs-Cross-Platform-App-Development-Mobile.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Native-vs-Cross-Platform-App-Development-Mobile-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Native-vs-Cross-Platform-App-Development-Mobile-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Native-vs-Cross-Platform-App-Development-Mobile-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>7 Advantages of Native Development</h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Smooth work</b>. Native technologies connect with the device’s functionality, which makes processing fast and steady.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Compatibility</b>. Thanks to seamless integration with hardware, native apps can take photos, track locations, and add events to the calendar.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Safety</b>. The minimum of layers and technologies make native apps secure.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>User experience</b>. In terms of UX design, native apps can have sophisticated layouts, greater personalization, and engaging animations users like.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Easy-to-use SDK</b>. For developers, native app building possesses numerous tools that make the process faster and cheaper. In this regard, software development kits are extremely helpful and streamline the development process with up-to-date and mostly ready for implementation parts of code and libraries. In case something is not clear, it’s easy to find and understand the technical guides and official documentation.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Optimization</b>. Native apps don’t overload the battery with complex processing, and users can use them longer.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Maintenance</b>. Updates like AI, IoT, and adding extra features and easy to implement on native apps.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3 Disadvantages of Native Development</h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Expensive to start</b>. Although native apps possess value-for-money in a long run, the initial cost of their development is high. Each platform requires separate investment, and the development expenses are generally 30-40% higher than going for the cross-platform app development option that covers all the devices at once.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Time to market</b>. Native development is complex and requires more attention on each stage, which delays the date when the app is ready to launch.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Different codebases</b>. Android and iOS app development are completely different, and the developers need to duplicate each feature by using two separate codebases. Because of this, native app development requires two separate teams at times.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Best Cases of Native Apps</h2>
<p>Thanks to its benefits and efficiency indicators, native app development is highly popular these days. You can find native apps among games, messaging platforms, and navigation tools.</p>
<p>Among the loudest examples of native apps, there are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Spotify</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Waze</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">WhatsApp</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Pokemon Go</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Facebook (Mark Zuckerberg initially invested in a hybrid app, but soon recognized the mistake and build a native version for iOS)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Is Cross-Platform Development?</h2>
<p>You need a single database to build a cross-platform app running on several devices. Due to this advantage of repurposing, the development itself becomes faster and cheaper. The majority of code, meaning 70-95%, can be reused in another platform, which makes building for Android and iOS smooth.</p>
<p>In this regard, React Native, Flutter, Ionic, and Xamarin cover the most tasks for both operating systems. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/869224/worldwide-software-developer-working-hours/">Statista</a>, Flutter is the leading framework for cross-platform development, covering 42% of the market. Next is React Native, possessing 38%. The full picture is shown in the table below.</p>

<h2>4 Advantages of Cross-Platform Development</h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Repurposing of code</b>. Cross-platform apps are easy to adapt to multiple devices thanks to 80% of code that can be reused.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cost-effectiveness</b>. Cross-platform development cuts costs and saves time on the development stage, compared to native development.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Fewer developers are needed</b>. The development is not complex, so you won’t need to recruit separate teams to build Android and iOS apps.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Access to a broader audience</b>. Cross-platform apps are the best option to showcase your app to more people and/or the new market.</li>
</ol>
<h2>4 Disadvantages of Cross-Platform App Development</h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Unstable performance</b>. The general usability of the codebase comes at its cost. The lack of specification sometimes causes delays.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Simplified UX</b>. Compared to native apps, some features and layouts are unavailable for cross-platform apps. In this situation, the elaboration on the cross-platform user interface is very important for getting satisfactory results in terms of user experience.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relying on external libraries</b>. As there is almost no support to SDKs, developers can face difficulties in integrating new features.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>QA is a must</b>. Without several rounds of testing, cross-platform apps are likely to disappoint users with numerous bugs, safety issues, and incompatibilities.</li>
</ol>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24795 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Kyiv.jpg" alt="Outsourcing Software Development to Ukraine Kyiv" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Kyiv.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Kyiv-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Kyiv-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Kyiv-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In 2021, the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) in their <a href="https://www.iaop.org/Content/19/165/5309" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual ranking</a> of the world’s best outsourcing companies has named eleven tech companies based in Ukraine, considering customer reviews, certifications and awards, solutions approach, and the basic social responsibility projects of each.</p>
<p>Being listed in these and lots of other international rankings, Ukraine is now one of the most attractive yet prospective outsourcing destinations for the world’s largest and most renowned corporations. The level of proficiency and comprehensive list of tech skills obtained by its developers makes more and more companies switch to Ukraine software outsourcing.</p>
<blockquote><p>The latest analysis by the <a href="https://2020.stateofeuropeantech.com/chapter/investments/article/investments-geo-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of European Tech</a> has shown that Ukrainian tech raised around $571 million of investments in 2020, and due to the increasing demand in digital transformation, these numbers will only rise further.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this article, we will uncover why IT outsourcing in Ukraine is so beneficial to businesses, what scopes the Ukraine developers are best for and how to find a reliable outsourcing vendor and hire the best software developers in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Let’s get it started!</p>
<h2>The Emerging Popularity of Ukrainian Outsourcing: International Rankings</h2>
<p>As we mentioned before, Ukraine has been recognized as one of the world’s best IT outsourcing centers.</p>
<blockquote><p>By 2025, the overall number of Ukraine developers will reach 250,000, with an overall <a href="https://ukraineinvest.gov.ua/news/looking-beyond-the-discovered-tech-horizons-outsourcing-to-ukraine-vs-poland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IT market value of $8,4 billion</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>At present, the country had gained compelling positions in numerous international tech-related rankings, including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">20th position in the <a href="https://www.kearney.com/digital/gsli/2019-full-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AT Kearney Global Services Location Index</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">2nd rank in the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_gii_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 Global Innovation Index by Wipo</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">1st position for Science &amp; Technology in the <a href="https://index.goodcountry.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good Country Index</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">1st position for Innovation Input to Output Performance in <a href="https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_gii_2020/ua.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Innovation Index 2020 </a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are only a few software development outsourcing Ukraine statistics that justify the tremendous popularity of its professional specialists on the global IT market.</p>
<h2>Main Services to Consider for Outsourcing Software Development in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Before we’ll dive into the pricing of outsourcing software development in Ukraine, it’s critical to investigate whether or not its developers can fully correspond to all the needs of your company, organization, or business.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it’s no use hiring developers that are experienced in creating the software for the hospitality industry for your eCommerce business. Furthermore, bad hires like choosing the wrong software vendors can result not only in time or progress loss but also can cost millions of dollars for contracting authority!</p>
<p>So, what basic projects can Ukraine developers be hired for?</p>
<h3>Custom Software Development</h3>
<p>First of all, the strong side of IT outsourcing in Ukraine is developing powerful software solutions for nearly any business from any industry. Do you need the proof? Then, you might check out the famous startups like Petcube, Grammarly, DepositPhotos, and more &#8211; originally created in Ukraine, these software solutions are now widely known all over the world.</p>
<p>Whatever project you’re planning to launch, with Ukrainian software developers you’ll surely get the stablest, feature-rich yet effective applications you’ve paid for.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24799 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Teamwork.jpg" alt="Outsourcing Software Development to Ukraine Teamwork" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Teamwork.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Teamwork-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Teamwork-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Teamwork-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Internet of Things</h3>
<p>Any type of IoT device always implies the usage of personal data, which traditionally needs comprehensive protection to minimize the possible threats. Unlike the other outsourcing vendors, Ukraine developers are more competitive in the global outsourcing market because of their extensive experience in working with the personal data of EU, UK, and North American citizens.</p>
<p>Along with governmental personal data regulations of Ukraine (ISO), each company tracks the regulations of the client’s country, ranging from GDPR (EU), PIPEDA (Canada), and HIPAA (USA). At the same time, clients can also initiate the additional data protection requirements: how it’s collected, stored, accessed, and transferred.</p>
<p>One of the well-known IoT projects of Ukraine developers is Ajax System, an IoT security ecosystem that provides wireless security equipment for private and business use.</p>
<h3>AI Technology</h3>
<p>In 2020, Ukraine has become one of the leading countries by the number of Artificial Intelligence providers in Europe. <a href="https://clutch.co/ua/developers/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Clutch</a>, at present, there are over 150 organizations targeted on Artificial Intelligence development, which precedes the number of AI companies in most technologically advanced EU countries like Poland, Estonia, Belarus, Germany, and more.</p>
<p>So far, there are over 30,000 software developers in Ukraine specializing in AI &amp; ML development. The Ukrainian software developers have a strong knowledge of Scala, Hadoop and Python technologies, which are considered to be an integral part of Data Science and Machine Learning.</p>
<h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for good, experienced app developers, outsourcing software developers in Ukraine may be the right option for you. These programmers perform exceptionally well in creating solid, feature-rich yet functional mobile apps according to all the requirements and your business needs.</p>
<p>Besides, these services are delivered at comparatively low prices: with the average hourly rate starting from $20 to $60, the cost of making an app with the basic features starts from $5,000. In contrast, the same in the USA will cost you from $10,000 &#8211; 20,000 and around $18,000 &#8211; 20,000 in Great Britain and Western Europe.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ukrainian software developers feature the best ratio of quality and price, provide flexibility in communication and cooperation, and offer innovative solutions that exactly fit your business needs and goals.</p>
<h3>Blockchain</h3>
<p>At present, blockchain is a comparatively new and innovative technology that requires building solid and functional solutions and is now used in a wide range of fields: financial industry, supply chains, government, healthcare, retail, and more.</p>
<p>However, if choosing a non-experienced vendor for the project in any scope, companies can fail in blockchain technology implementation and get a serious loss of the investments and even the critical data as well.</p>
<p>Hiring blockchain software developers in Ukraine can enhance the security of any type of data, as they have:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">the in-depth knowledge of the major blockchain services</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">vast experiences in working with different platforms, such as Bitcoin, Etherum, HyperLedger Fabric (for private corporate networks), and EOS (introduced by Smart Contracts)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">blockchain development language skills, including Go, Rust, Python, C++, and Solidity</li>
</ul>
<p>With this technology implemented, your business will get more transparency and enhanced traceability for your data, reduce costs and eliminate transaction speed.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24794 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Kyiv-City.jpg" alt="Outsourcing Software Development to Ukraine Kyiv City" width="640" height="424" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Kyiv-City.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Kyiv-City-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Kyiv-City-600x398.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Kyiv-City-450x298.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>Rates for Outsourcing Software Development in Ukraine</h2>
<p>Being one of the leading IT outsourcing centers in Eastern Europe, hiring Ukrainian software developers can be <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/best-it-outsourcing-strategies-pros-and-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a winning strategy</a> for a variety of businesses from different industry scopes. The most popular industries they are involved in include insurance, healthcare, hospitality, finance, eCommerce, construction, and more.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another great plus of the Ukraine developer is the solid software knowledge, fluent English proficiency, and reasonable price for the IT services. For instance, the average offshore development rates for this region range from $30 to $60 per hour.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the overall software development outsourcing Ukraine rates may vary according to the work experience of a certain candidate:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hourly rate for Junior Software Engineer: $19 &#8211; $25</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hourly rate for Middle Software Engineer: $26 &#8211; $38</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hourly rate for Senior Software Engineer: $39 &#8211; $60</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the rates of countries based in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, you’ll get top-of-the-line innovative software solutions at an affordable price.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ukraine is a home country for over 200,000 professionals, and their number increases with more than 36,000 graduates within this scope annually. These factors make it one of the most attractive options for starting outsourcing software development in Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Main Reasons to Hire Ukrainian Software Developers</h2>
<p>After you know the overall information about IT outsourcing in Ukraine, let’s now discuss why you should consider hiring Ukrainian developers.</p>
<h3>#1 Largest IT outsourcing Market in CEE</h3>
<p>Ukraine is the 2nd largest tech hub in Central Eastern Europe, with over 200,000 programmers located in the 5 biggest cities: Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Odessa. Furthermore, compared to Poland, it offers more attractive outsourcing rates at the same or even higher quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, it takes 11th position in the rating of top software development outsourcing countries in the world. According to recent research, over 90% of IT services in Ukraine are outsourced, while the remaining 10% develop their own programming products.</p>
<h3>#2 Solid Educational Background of Developers</h3>
<p>There are around 450 technical universities and colleges with advanced programming courses, and over 36,000 new graduates annually enroll in the IT market. Most of them start practicing their programming skills after the 2nd or 3rd course of their bachelor’s degree, which makes it even more beneficial to be hired after graduation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, nearly all the Ukrainian developers can fluently speak English at the Intermediate (more than 37%), Upper-intermediate (over 35%), or even Advanced levels (around 13%).</p>
<p>This ensures smooth communication yet more productive cooperation between the certain organization and outsourced team of Ukrainian software developers.</p>
<p>These are only a few qualities that significantly stimulate the demand for outsourcing talented Ukrainian developers.</p>
<h3>#3 Plenty of IT Service Outsourcing Companies</h3>
<p>Most IT outsourcing companies in Ukraine offer Flexible cooperation models within only 1-2 hours away from most European countries. At present, there are over 1,600 companies that provide the core web technologies for software development, including JavaScript, Java, C#, Python, PHP, C++, TypeScript, and more.</p>
<p>Most of these tech companies are founded by entrepreneurs with a global mindset, such organizations are mostly focused on delivering the best results to their contractors and facilitating their success as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24796 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Process.jpg" alt="Outsourcing Software Development to Ukraine Process" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Process-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Process-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Process-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>#4 Impressive Value/Cost Rates</h3>
<p>By offering the most beneficial yet attractive prices for the services, Ukraine has already become one of the best IT outsourcing hubs in Europe. It features lower average rates for the services provided and has much more programming specialists within any industry. So, it’s more than possible to hire:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Junior-level programmer for $570 for 1 month</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Middle-level Ukraine developer for $1800 per month</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Senior-level specialist for around $3000 for one month of work</li>
</ul>
<p>And, we can reassure you, the software products developed have not only the same quality as those created in other CEE countries. Ofter, Ukrainian software developers provide even better technological solutions for specific cases than can be offered in most international leading IT hubs!</p>
<h3>#5 Convenient Location and Time Zone</h3>
<p>The geographic proximity makes Ukraine one of the most attractive locations for both nearshoring and offshoring. Placed in just 2-3 hours of flight time from most of the European countries, it allows sharing 7 of 9 business hours with the majority of them.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are always direct flights from Ukraine to the most popular European tech hubs including Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and more. And, the flight ticket can be purchased for as little as $15 &#8211; 19.</p>
<h3>#6 More Working Hours Per Week</h3>
<p>An average full-time developer works around 33 hours per week, in the UK these numbers can barely reach 36 hours, which is not too far from the US workers (37.5 hours per week).</p>
<p>In Ukraine, the majority of developers in tech-related outsourcing companies spend between 40 to 60 hours at work per week. Furthermore, your company can benefit from the public holidays too: there are only 11 paid public holidays in Ukraine, which is 2-7 days less compared to most EU countries.</p>
<p>Of course, that might not be too notable at first, but such a slight working hour difference can enhance up to several months in certain cases of project completion.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24798 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Team.jpg" alt="Outsourcing Software Development to Ukraine Team" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Team.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Team-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Team-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Team-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>How to Find the Reliable Outsourcing Vendor in Ukraine</h2>
<p>For sure, when it comes to IT outsourcing, Ukrainian software developers are <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/why-do-companies-outsource/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most beneficial options to choose</a>. At the same time, it’s still critical to learn the most important aspects to consider when choosing the software developing company for hire.</p>
<p>This can prevent the loss of time, efforts, and investments for your organization, and ensures you won’t need to start the outsourcing organization research from scratch.</p>
<p>So, what are the core things to pay attention to when choosing the right IT outsourcing vendor in Ukraine?</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Uncover the local IT industry landscape and the top vendors you can hire Ukraine developers from</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Ask for the portfolio and existing case studies of your potential candidate, explore the major scopes/industries and companies the IT company cooperated earlier with. Remember, you should look not for the company that features the best technological solutions, you should find the one that can provide the exact software products your business or company needs</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Analyze the awards, certificates, and compliances to define whether or not this software vendor can be trusted. As a rule, the outsourcing companies have certifications from the leading tech providers within the same scope (if you’re looking for cloud solutions development, you should probably look for AWS or Google Cloud partnership). Other great certifications to look for are ISO 27001:2013, ISO 9001:2015, PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, and more.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Define the strong sides of your potential IT outsourcing vendor and why it’s better than other competitors. You should also pay attention to the price/value rate to avoid low-quality outcomes. Additionally, browse the official website, corporate blogs, and social media of the outsourcing company to get a more concrete idea of what types of projects they have already done and what was the quality of their final results.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Contact the software vendor and estimate whether or not they’re open for communication. For instance, the modern outsourcing companies in Ukraine like Intellecsoft invite for an expert consultation regarding the project or problem you have to get the overall idea about it and whether or not they can help you with the exact services you need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, that’s only a general list of what should be checked when choosing the best IT outsourcing vendors in Ukraine. Nevertheless, with having all <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/collaboration-with-an-outsourcing-vendor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these aspects</a> checked, you can be more than certain about getting the best software solutions for your business.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To sum up, onboarding software developers in Ukraine is one of the most beneficial ways for companies and businesses to obtain innovative technological solutions and approaches at a reasonable price.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24793 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Developer.jpg" alt="Outsourcing Software Development to Ukraine Developer" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Developer.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Developer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Developer-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Outsourcing-Software-Development-to-Ukraine-Developer-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given the circumstances of today’s working conditions, we can assume that remote work isn’t going anywhere any time soon. Thus, we need to determine whether outsourcing is limited to the realm of remote development or if product management can be outsourced as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24527 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Process" width="640" height="420" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process-600x394.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Process-450x295.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Before, we were confident that it was possible to outsource everything except the product team. But after a time we began to wonder, why can’t product teams be remote too?</p>
<p>This article will discuss whether remote product management and development are realistic and consider both the pros and cons of each.</p>
<h2>Common Reasons for Outsourcing</h2>
<p>Every month at Intellectsoft, we speak with dozens of companies that are considering remote development. Most often, they fall into one of several categories:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Small to medium businesses that digitize a business model </b><b>with proven offline results</b>. In this case, the company has a working knowledge of how an online business should work. They simply bring existing business processes online.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Companies that scale up existing business processes.</b> This case includes all those who have built successful MVPs but are now thinking about scaling their success by adding more functionality to reach a larger audience.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Companies that are working on a one-time addition to existing functionality. </b>In such cases, it makes no sense to hire someone from the outside due to the irregular nature of the development work.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Businesses that plan to develop a solution from scratch.</b> Usually, these include companies that need a specific business solution and then long-term support. They do not intend to periodically change the product, conduct dozens of AB tests, and so on. Just building, deploying, and using is their purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recently, due to COVID-19, more and more companies are doing what was previously considered impossible. They are transitioning product and marketing development to remote.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-24529 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Manager" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Manager-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h2>
<h2>Why Product Management Is Moving to Remote</h2>
<p>Both well-developed businesses and young startups have been resorting to outsourcing for product management. Some of the most common reasons for this include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lack of qualified human resources.</b> Often, teams don&#8217;t have enough in-house resources to test new products or research a new segment of users and do it right. This is where remote teams come in handy.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>They need new products or features urgently, and deadlines are on fire. </b>Imagine you’re a face mask production and the pandemic strikes. Now you want to quickly scale production and customer acquisition channels but don&#8217;t have enough workforce to do so. That’s when you don’t have time to hire and onboard new staff and need someone who can ship things right away.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Need solid product expertise for good money. </b>A company has no experience working with developers and product managers. They cannot spend a year and a half on acquiring expertise, hiring personnel, and developing it. In this case, it is better to turn to those who have sufficient expertise.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The current team is failing and product development needs to be accelerated. </b>If a company is willing to try a product-led growth model, the product manager has to be a seasoned professional. The current team may not be the best fit for the product-led growth philosophy or meet the new requirements for development speed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Critical Role of the Product Manager</h2>
<p>The position of a product manager has only been around for a short time. There are plenty of definitions of what a PM is. But for all of them, there is one that we can stick to. The product manager is the person responsible for creating and bringing a new product to market.</p>
<p>Suppose you look through hundreds of PM vacancies and conduct an in-depth analysis. Soon, it becomes clear that a product manager is a specialist who works at the intersection of business, marketing, and programming.</p>
<p>At every stage, they control the work on a new product, interact with investors and users, and develop their brainchild after the technical implementation.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the main task is to develop new products in line with trends and the needs of users. Beyond this, there are plenty of other responsibilities and fields of expertise for a PM:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Collecting information</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Deriving product requirements</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Creating a work plan and distributing roles among staff</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Promoting and selling the product</li>
</ul>
<p>Product manager&#8217;s top skills:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">market research and market analysis to determine the basic needs of customers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">implementation of product lines and testing new ideas</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">conducting competitive analysis, comparing similar products through numerous characteristics</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">development of marketing communications</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">liaising with the sales director to create a sales strategy</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">working with clients and the sales department to assess the results of implementation</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">formation of long-term and short-term sales forecasts, providing analytics to management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">introducing new products to the market, analyzing profitability (ROI)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">creating a marketing strategy with the marketers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">pricing based on market research, production costs, and expected demand</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">scheduling and defining operational requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a crucial role for any project. So why would a big company&#8217;s CEO outsource a product manager or an entire product team?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24528 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Discussion" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Discussion-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>Reasons for Outsourcing the Product Manager and Product Team</h2>
<p>Well, there are a couple of reasons to do so. First, you get world-class experts working on your product. These professionals usually take jobs for a limited period of time tied directly to KPIs or a set of other mission-critical objectives like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The number of conversions and sign-ups compared to the current performance.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Marginality. The actual sales are compared with the planned figures.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Active users. Evaluate how many people are using the product daily.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Customer Retention Rate (CRR). The retention rate of new users, which in most cases is even more critical than the acquisition.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">ROI. An indicator of the return on income tied to the cost of advertising. It shows whether the investment has paid off or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delivering these KPIs means that the remote project manager and their development team are responsible for more than just releasing new functionality. They are entirely responsible for achieving specific business goals.</p>
<p>Leading product development experts often command high salaries. Thus, hiring them as full-time in-house staff can be incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>Additionally, product design and prototyping equipment can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, not including the costs of maintenance and repair. Outsourced product development is often much less expensive than in-house design.</p>
<p>And in the end, you are not responsible for your outsourced product team. This is very useful if you are testing a product MVP based on market hypotheses. You can quickly terminate cooperation if the test was unsuccessful and the product-market fit was not found. Most outsourced product teams agree on that with their clients in advance.</p>
<h2>What Is the Future of Product Team Outsourcing?</h2>
<p>At Intellectsoft, we see a roughly 25% increase in clients wanting to include product managers and analysts as part of their outsourced teams.</p>
<p>Agile development methodology allows for one product specialist to work on 1-3 projects simultaneously, alternating the planning, prototyping, development, and analysis phases among themselves.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24526 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office.jpg" alt="Product Team On-Demand Office" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office.jpg 640w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Product-Team-On-Demand-Office-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The only requirement for organizing a high-performing team of this level is the willingness of stakeholders to adhere to the process and agreed priorities. Remote product teams are capable of quick pivots, but only within extended sprints.</p>
<p>We anticipate that product management and analyst outsourcing will become more mainstream over the next three years in the wake of traditional marketing and development outsourcing.</p>
<p>As skilled specialist shortages and prices grow, availability and affordable prices will become critical factors in attracting these teams to an increasing number of players in the market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, global tech companies are experiencing a talent shortage. As the McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/building-workforce-skills-at-scale-to-thrive-during-and-after-the-covid-19-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report shows</a>, it’s harder to find employees with the needed workforce skills and the ability to work remotely efficiently.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24118 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Team.jpg" alt="Dedicated Offshore Development Center Team" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Team.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Team-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Team-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Team-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Team-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>Among the concrete measures taken, these firms tend to hire, contract, redeploy, release, and build skills within the current workforce.</p>
<p>In any scenario, investing in software development enlargement will be a costly incentive. For reducing the expenses, it’s relevant to refer to outsourcing and get external executives for a lower cost.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the given circumstances, ODC (offshore development center) serves as an upgraded solution to traditional outsourcing and promises better operational management, cost-effectiveness, and IT expertise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Check our guide on getting all the details relevant to the task of establishing an offshore software development center for your business.</p>
<h2>What Is a Dedicated Offshore Development Center</h2>
<p>Simply put, ODC (offshore development center) is a separate development office, or a corporate branch, situated in another country.</p>
<p>The greatest thing is access to the vast pool of talents you can hire for an affordable price and without the need to manage operational and support tasks on your own. As one of the best offshoring models, it works for any industry and corporate size — and helps you strengthen the weak positions in your business smartly and reasonably.</p>
<blockquote><p>With a stable link to the headquarters, offshore software development services hold the brand identity and all the standards and principles of your company.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because of this, it’s hard to differentiate the result your offshore partner and your in-house team deliver. And all this comes at a reasonable cost, as you’ll get the developers more than twice cheaper than building an extra development office on your own.</p>
<h2>Offshore Development Center Models</h2>
<p>There are 3 main models under which offshore software development can work:</p>
<h3>Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)</h3>
<p>In this scenario, you get a team that takes the whole responsibility for the project delivered. It works well if you need to establish long-term cooperation where the exact appearance of tasks changes on the go.</p>
<h3>Build Operate Transfer (BOT)</h3>
<p>This model means hiring a remote team to deliver project tasks and set up processes from scratch. BOT reveals its best for startups and mid-size companies that request keeping intellectual rights over the product made by the offshore software development center.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24122 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Workplace.jpg" alt="Dedicated Offshore Development Center Workplace" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Workplace.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Workplace-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Workplace-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Workplace-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Workplace-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<h3>Mixed Scenario</h3>
<p>In this model, you can hire extra IT specialists who will complete the tasks not envisioned at the beginning of your cooperation. The more dynamic your project is, the more relevant this scenario is.</p>
<p>Moreover, an offshore development center can operate on a contractor or customer basis. For the contractor model, you send your requirements to the team, and it completes them as the set of technical and managerial tasks.</p>
<p>In the customer ODC model, the remote team concentrates on coding, while the main office handles the rest of the tasks. Picking the exact model depends on the scope of tasks you have.</p>
<h2>The Difference Between Offshore Development Centers and Outsourcing</h2>
<p>Firms frequently choose between simple outsourcing and offshore software development services. In the first case, you hire third-party executors in any location to deliver your project, while the offshore development center is the self-managed team situated in another country.</p>
<p>Here are 4 main differences between these two models:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The level of dedication</b>. Software engineers who are interested in product excellence tend to choose offshore software development to work. In contrast to developers working on an outsourcing basis, they get a deeper understanding of the corporate service and manage to commit more to the things they do.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Costs for scaling</b>. Outsourcing is normally a cheaper option, but offshore development centers are cost-effective to expand your business smartly. The price is higher, but the return on investment justifies this slight overpayment. For more information on fundamental outsourcing pricing models available, <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/outsourcing-pricing-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check this blog post</a>.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Control over the team</b>. If you hire a sole developer, outsourcing gives you a sufficient level of control over the executor. But offshore development centers provide you with more effective tools for successful team management.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Access to tech talents</b>. You can dedicate time and collect experience to differentiate a good developer from a bad one while relying on the outsourcing model. In the offshore software development center, you’ll have a service provider with already established connections to the best IT specialists in the country. You don’t need to search for them on your own.</li>
</ol>
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-24119 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Teamwork.jpg" alt="Dedicated Offshore Development Center Teamwork" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Teamwork.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Teamwork-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Teamwork-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Teamwork-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Teamwork-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></h3>
<h3>The Typical Structure of Offshore Development Centers</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Software engineers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">QA engineers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Back-end developers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Front-end developers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Web designers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">UI/UX designers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Technical writers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Project Manager / Team Lead</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Account Manager</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s important: offshore IT services won’t need operational officers. All the accounting and HR management is taken on the shoulders of your service provider.</p>
<p>That’s why you can free your head from the micromanagement hassle and concentrate on strategic tasks and vision elaboration.</p>
<h2>6 Key Offshore Development Center Benefits for Your Project</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cost-saving</b>. The solution is always more affordable than enlarging your in-house team. At the bare minimum, you get tech talents from the country with lower hourly rates.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Same branding</b>. Offshore development services need your corporate policy and standards to ensure the result is compliant with your core brand.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Domain expertise</b>. The tech talents hired will possess the narrow expertise needed for the particular tasks your in-house team lacks. And so, you’ll get the cost-effective corporate branch that will strengthen your company.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>High flexibility</b>. Offshore software development operates under a flexible pricing model, meaning you’ll pay for the services needed and easily hire new team members once your project starts scaling.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cost-effective infrastructure</b>. You’ll get an offshore office with all the facilities and equipment needed. Moreover, operational management is included in the offshore development center service by default.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Technical support</b>. The offshore software development center guarantees constant technical assistance during the whole project delivery. Being interested in an excellent result, the team is always reachable and collects all the knowledge needed to manage the problems fast and accurately.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Checklist of Setting Up Successful Offshore Development Centers</h2>
<h3>1. Clarify your needs</h3>
<p>Select the exact location you want to enter to clarify for yourself the cultural specifics of your target audience and the technical skills needed for your product. The exact project requirements can be vague, as the service provider will negotiate the project scope and get the executives required only.</p>
<h3>2. Do your research to find a good vendor</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, not each firm can offer the full scope of services needed for offshore software development. That’s why it’s important to get a provider who possesses expertise in this exact service to save you time and nerves in the long run. While picking the vendor, consider the portfolio, testimonials, and English proficiency, among other subjective factors.</p>
<h3>3. Make sure the provider knows the local market</h3>
<p>The key to success in establishing an offshore development center is getting local tech talents in the area you’re interested in. This way, you’ll get a team with a deep understanding of your target audience in terms of its cultural and social specifics.</p>
<h3>4. Make costs flexible</h3>
<p>You’ll pay only for services needed in the offshore development center model and get the bill with detailed descriptions and transparent pricing.</p>
<h3>4. Get legal support</h3>
<p>For signing the contract, you’ll need your lawyers. Get the ones who know the national laws and can introduce the best terms in your agreement with the service provider.</p>
<h3>5. Recruit and establish an office</h3>
<p>Either together with your service provider or on your own, get the office space where your team will work. Also, elaborate and negotiate the candidate profile, the team size, and the equipment needed.</p>
<h3>6. Interview the candidates</h3>
<p>Make sure you can see the people you hire in your own eyes and agree on each team member who will work for you. This is important since the team is an integral part of your company.</p>
<h3>7. Agree on the operational management</h3>
<p>Decide on accounting, HR payroll, salaries, and other important terms on which your offshore development center will function. Your service provider will manage everything in the future, but you need to negotiate an accurate environment.</p>

<h2>When Does It Make Sense to Invest in Offshore Software Development</h2>
<p>Not each business needs offshore IT services. At the same time, their advantages are suitable for any industry and business size — that’s why establishing your own offshore development center may become necessary anytime.</p>
<h3>Condition #1. You Need Engineers with Narrow Expertise</h3>
<p>Getting a new in-house team member is tough once you know whom you need. This way, getting talented developers offshore is a fast and accurate solution. Once you refer to the service provider, you articulate the tech stack and the technology needed, and your tech partner finds the exact specialists that can deliver the result.</p>
<h3>Condition #2. You Need to Scale Fast</h3>
<p>The offshore development center service solves the problem of hiring several talented specialists at once for further business expansion. This way, you can get developers native to the new market you’re about to enter.</p>
<h3>Condition #3. You Need to Delegate the Project</h3>
<p>Hiring an offshore development center is the best way to guarantee the excellent delivery of the project you’ve been working on and concentrate on more important business tasks.</p>
<p>Working as a unified team highly interested in your corporate good, they will invest all their effort and tech expertise in the job done.</p>
<h3>Condition #4. Project Security is Your Key Concern</h3>
<p>Since offshore development centers operate as the corporate branch, the executives share the security standards applied in your firm. You will sign an NDA with the team and put it in a physically secure office after hiring.</p>
<h2>Best Locations to Set Up Offshore Development Centers</h2>
<h3>Ukraine</h3>
<p>Ukraine is considered as the top choice for setting up an offshore development center, as the experience of Grammarly, Samsung, and BigCommerce shows.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24120 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Ukraine.jpg" alt="Dedicated Offshore Development Center Ukraine" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Ukraine.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Ukraine-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Ukraine-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Ukraine-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dedicated-Offshore-Development-Center-Ukraine-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>With professional education and numerous IT companies to get relevant experience, Ukrainian tech talents are highly valued in the world. Many of them join in-house teams in the companies situated in the USA and Europe, while the rest prefer to stay in the country and work in an offshore development center.</p>
<h3>India</h3>
<p>This Asian country is known for cheaper pricing and numerous centers already established. These factors make this location attractive for companies like Google, Adobe, and IBM. However, getting a reliable vendor is tough in India since the average service quality level is lower than in Ukraine. Moreover, the latter country doesn’t possess that striking cultural differences and that big timezone gap.</p>
<h3>China</h3>
<p>As the second popular Asian country for outsourcing services, China is steadily getting more clients requesting offshore development services. You can consider this option seriously too, especially if you’re aiming at expanding to the local market.</p>
<h3>Romania</h3>
<p>This Eastern European country is the choice for companies like Nokia, Microsoft, and Intel. Romanian vendors have a reliable reputation, so you can request their services too.</p>
<h2>Find a Reliable Partner for Offshore Development Services: Ask Intellectsoft for Help</h2>
<p>Since software development outsourcing is a <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/software-development-outsourcing-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risky incentive</a>, your offshore development center should have a reliable service provider. Generally, the lack of trust, cultural miscommunication, and insufficient control are the main obstacles to fruitful cooperation with a chosen vendor. That’s why the step of getting a true tech partner is so crucial.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a huge honor to announce that Intellectsoft’s CEO Vlad Vahromovs has become a member of Forbes Business Council,  the foremost growth and networking organization for successful business owners and leaders worldwide.</p>
<p>Forbes Councils is a collective of invitation-only communities created in partnership with Forbes and the expert community builders who founded Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC).</p>
<p>It is an organization for accomplished small and mid-sized business owners, respected industry leaders, and executives with deep and diverse experience in leadership, management, customer engagement, technology &amp; growth. In Forbes Councils, exceptional business owners and leaders come together with the people and resources that can help them thrive.</p>
<p>Vlad Vahromovs was vetted and selected by a review committee based on the depth and diversity of his experience. Criteria for acceptance include a track record of successfully impacting business growth metrics, as well as personal and professional achievements and honors.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Vlad spent over 15 years in the IT industry, business operations specifically.
